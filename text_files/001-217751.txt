It may be subject to editorial revision.In the case of Ecodefence and Others v. Russia,The European Court of Human Rights (Third Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of: Georges Ravarani, President, Georgios A. Serghides,  Darian Pavli, Anja Seibert-Fohr, Peeter Roosma, Andreas Zünd, Frédéric Krenc, judges,and Milan Blaško, Section Registrar,Having regard to:the sixty-one applications against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by seventy-three Russian non-governmental organisations and their directors (“the applicants”), on the dates indicated in the Appendix;the decision to give notice to the Russian Government (“the Government”) of the complaints concerning restrictions on the applicants’ rights to freedom of expression and association and the protection against discrimination and undue pressure, and to declare inadmissible the remainder of the applications;the observations submitted by the respondent Government and the observations in reply submitted by the applicants;the comments submitted by the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights (“the Commissioner”) (Article 36 § 3 of the Convention);the comments submitted by the following third-party interveners who were granted leave to intervene by the President of the Section (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention): the Institute for Law and Public Policy (ILPP); the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders (“the Special Rapporteur”); the International Service for Human Rights (ISHR); the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ); Amnesty International; a group of Hungarian non-governmental organisations including the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, Transparency International Hungary, Atlatszo.hu, and the Eötvös Károly Policy Institute (“the Hungarian NGOs”); the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (Poland); and the Media Legal Defence Initiative;the decision of the President of the Chamber to appoint Judge G.A. Serghides to sit as an ad hoc judge (Rule 29 § 2 (b) of the Rules of Court), Mr Mikhail Lobov, the judge elected in respect of Russia, having withdrawn from sitting in the case (Rule 28 § 3), and none of three persons designated by the Government as eligible to serve as ad hoc judges making themselves available to the Court (Rule 29 §§ 1 (c) and 5);Having deliberated in private on 17 May 2022,Delivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date:INTRODUCTION1.  The present cases concern restrictions on the freedom of expression and association of Russian non-governmental organisations (NGOs) which have been categorised as “foreign agents” funded by “foreign sources” and exercising “political activity”.THE FACTS2.  The applicants are Russian NGOs and, in some cases, their directors. The names of the applicants and their representatives are given in the Appendix.3.  The Government were initially represented by Mr A. Fedorov and Mr M. Galperin, former Representatives of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and later by their successor in this office, Mr M. Vinogradov.4.  The applicant NGOs had operated for a long time under the same legal regime as any other Russian NGOs. They were active in civil society issues, human rights, the protection of the environment and cultural heritage, education, social security and migration.5.  In 2012 the new Foreign Agents Act was enacted (for details, see the following section). It required Russian NGOs which were deemed to engage in “political activity” and to have been in receipt of “foreign funding” to seek registration as “foreign agents”, under the threat of administrative and criminal sanctions. They were also required to label their publications as originating from a “foreign-agent” organisation, post information on their activities on the Internet and submit to more extensive accounting and reporting requirements.6.  Since 2012 the Foreign Agents Act has been updated several times. In June 2014 the Ministry of Justice was given the power to put organisations on the register of foreign agents at its own discretion. In 2016 the Foreign Agents Act was updated with a new definition of “political activity”.7.  After the Foreign Agents Act came into force, prosecutor’s offices and local justice departments required the applicant organisations and their directors to submit documents for an audit. They examined the documents and concluded that the applicant organisations fell within the definition of a “foreign agent”. The Ministry of Justice put most of the applicant organisations on the register of foreign agents. The facts specific to each case are set out in the Appendix.8.  The applicants unsuccessfully challenged the decisions of the justice departments and prosecutor’s offices before the domestic courts.9.  The application of the Foreign Agents Act has resulted in the imposition of administrative fines, financial expenditure, restrictions on the applicant organisations’ activities and the institution of criminal proceedings against the director of one organisation. Many applicant organisations were liquidated for violating the requirements applicable to “foreign agents”, or had to take decisions on self-liquidation because they were unable to pay the fines, or in order to avoid new sanctions.10.  On 28 and 29 December 2021 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation and the Moscow City Court, respectively, granted the prosecutor’s applications for the liquidation of the applicant organisations International Memorial and the Memorial Human Rights Centre and their field offices. The courts considered it established that the organisations – which the Ministry of Justice had put on the register of “foreign agents” – had committed “gross and repetitive” violations of “foreign-agent” legislation by failing to label their Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and other online publications as originating with a “foreign-agent” organisation. The courts held that, by “concealing [their] foreign-agent status”, the organisations failed to ensure “transparency of [their] activities”, prevented “proper public scrutiny of [their activities]”, and violated “the right of citizens to receive reliable information about [their] activities”, in flagrant violation of Russian law.11.  On 29 December 2021 the Court indicated to the Government, under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, that, in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings before it, the enforcement of the decisions to dissolve the two applicant organisations should be suspended for a period that would be necessary for the Court to consider the present case.12.  On 28 February and 5 April 2022 the Appeals Panel of the Supreme Court and the First Court of Appeals, respectively, dismissed the two organisations’ appeals against the dissolution orders.13.  International Memorial applied to the Supreme Court for a stay of execution of the liquidation decision, as directed by the interim measure. On 22 March 2022 the Supreme Court refused the application, ruling that the enforcement of the liquidation decision did not “prevent the organisation from exercising its rights under Article 34 of the Convention”, did not “create a risk of loss of life, health or irreparable harm to the organisation or its members” and did not “violate the constitutional right to freedom of association”.14.  On 5 April 2022 the liquidation decision was enforced and International Memorial was removed from the State Register of Legal Entities.RELEVANT LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND MATERIALTHE FOREIGN AGENTS ACTEnactment of the Foreign Agents ActDefinitions15.  In 2012 the Russian authorities adopted a series of amendments to the legislation on NGOs, which are collectively known as the Foreign Agents Act (Law no. 121-FZ of 13 July 2012). The Act introduced the notion of a “foreign agent” in section 2(6) of the Non-Commercial Organisations Act, Law no. 7-FZ of 12 January 1996 (“the NCO Act”), defining such an agent as:“... a Russian non-commercial organisation receiving funds and other property from foreign States, their governmental bodies, international and foreign organisations, foreign nationals, stateless persons or persons authorised by [any of the above], or Russian legal entities receiving funds and other property from the above-mentioned sources ... (‘foreign sources’) and which engages in political activity, including political activity carried out in the interests of foreign providers of funds, in the territory of the Russian Federation.”16.  The concept of “political activity” was defined as follows:“A non-commercial organisation, except for a political party, is considered to carry out political activity if, regardless of its statutory goals and purposes, it participates (including financially) in the organisation and implementation of political actions in order to influence State authorities’ decision-making process that affect State policy and public opinion.Activities in the following fields shall be excluded from the scope of ‘political activity’: science, culture, the arts, healthcare, the prevention of diseases and the protection of health, social security, the protection of motherhood and childhood, the social support of disabled persons, the promotion of a healthy lifestyle, physical well‑being and sports, the protection of flora and fauna, charitable activities, and the assistance of charities and voluntary organisations.”Additional requirements applicable to “foreign agents”(a)   Registration requirement17.  All organisations deemed to fit the definition of a “foreign agent” were required to file an application with the Ministry of Justice to be included on the register of foreign agents (section 32(7) of the NCO Act and section 29 of the Public Associations Act, Federal Law no. 82-FZ of 19 May 1995).(b)   Unscheduled inspections18.  “Foreign agents” were liable to have routine inspections by the Ministry of Justice, which were to be carried out at least once a year, and also to have unscheduled inspections in the circumstances listed in section 32(4.2) of the NCO Act, in particular if the Ministry of Justice received information from an individual, organisation or State authority indicating that an NGO was engaged in political activity and was financed from abroad but had failed to register as a “foreign agent”, and if a “foreign agent” organisation had asked to be deleted from the register of foreign agents.(c)   Labelling requirement19.  “Foreign agents” were required to label all the publications which they issued or distributed with a statement to the effect that those publications originated from an organisation which was listed as “foreign agent” (section 24 of the NCO Act).(d)   Accounting and auditing requirements20.  The Foreign Agents Act also introduced new accounting and auditing requirements. The financial reports of non-commercial organisations exercising the functions of a “foreign agent” were made subject to compulsory audits. The organisations were required to keep a separate statement of income or expenses obtained from foreign sources (section 32(1) of the NCO Act):“3. ... non-commercial organisations exercising the functions of a foreign agent shall submit an audit statement together with the above-mentioned documents. Moreover, the documents submitted by non-commercial organisations exercising the functions of a foreign agent shall contain information on the spending of funds and the use of other property received from foreign sources, and on their actual expenditure and use of property ...Non-commercial organisations exercising the functions of a foreign agent shall submit to a competent body [the Ministry of Justice] a report on their activities and the members of their management bodies every six months; every three months they shall submit documents containing information on the spending of funds and the use of other property, including funds and property received from foreign sources, and an audit statement shall be submitted every year”.(e)   Reporting requirements21.  “Foreign agents” were required to publish biannual and annual reports:“3.2. ... once a year, non-commercial organisations exercising the functions of a foreign agent shall publish on the Internet a report about their activities containing the same information as that submitted to a competent body [the Ministry of Justice] or its local department; and every six months the organisations will provide such a report for publication in the mass media.”22.  Government Regulation no. 212 of 15 April 2006 on the implementation of certain provisions of federal laws relating to non‑governmental organisations, prescribes that Russian NGOs are required to submit reports on their activities and the composition of their management bodies, and documents concerning their expenses and property every year (paragraph 2 (a)).Criminal and administrative liability23.  The Foreign Agents Act also created a new criminal offence of maliciously avoiding the obligation to submit documents required for registering an organisation as a “foreign agent” which is punishable with fines of up to 300,000 Russian roubles (RUB) or up to two years’ deprivation of liberty (Article 330.1 of the Criminal Code). On 30 December 2020 the maximum penalty under this provision was extended to five years’ imprisonment (Law no. 525-FZ).24.  On 12 November 2012 sanctions for a violation of the Foreign Agents Act were added to the Code of Administrative Offences (“the CAO”). The new Article 19.7.5-2 established a fine of between RUB 100,000 and RUB 300,000 (2,490 to 7,470 euros (EUR) at the exchange rate on the date of enactment) which could be imposed in relation to a “foreign-agent” organisation that submitted incomplete, incorrect or belated information to the State authorities. The new Article 19.34 punished non-commercial organisations for carrying out activities without being registered on the register of “foreign agents” (paragraph 1) or for failing to label publications as originating from a “foreign-agent” organisation (paragraph 2). The minimum fine for those offences was set at RUB 300,000, and the maximum fine at RUB 500,000 (EUR 12,450).25.  On 31 December 2014 the CAO was amended in line with a decision of the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 40 below). In particular, in accordance with the amended Article 4.1(2.2) and (3.2) of the CAO, by way of exception, where the nature and effects of an offender’s administrative offence, personality or financial situation so require, the amount of the fine may be fixed below the minimum amount in the relevant provisions of the CAO, where the minimum amount of the fine amounts to at least RUB 10,000 for individuals, RUB 50,000 for officials, and RUB 100,000 for organisations. The amount of the fine may not be less than half of the minimum amount of the fine provided for by the relevant provisions of the CAO. On 3 November 2015 the statute of limitations for non-compliance with the “foreign agent” legislation was extended from three months to one year (Law no. 304-FZ).Delegating to the Ministry of Justice the authority to add organisations to the list26.  On 4 June 2014 the NCO Act was amended to give the Ministry of Justice the power to add non-commercial organisations to the register of foreign agents if it considered that an organisation met the criteria set out in the Act (section 32(7)).Procedure for removing an organisation from the list27.  On 8 March 2015 a procedure for removing an organisation from the register of foreign agents was added to the NCO Act (section 32(7.1)). An organisation may be deleted from the list if, in particular, it has been liquidated or reorganised, or an extraordinary inspection has established that the organisation has not received foreign funding or engaged in political activity in Russia for a period of one year before filing the request for deletion.Updated definition of “political activity”28.  On 2 June 2016 the definition of political activity was updated to read:“A non-commercial organisation, except for a political party, is considered to carry out a political activity in Russian territory if, regardless of its statutory goals and purposes, it engages in activities in the fields of statehood, the protection of the Russian constitutional system, federalism, the protection of the Russian Federation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, the rule of law, public security, national security and defence, external policy, the Russian Federation’s social, economic and national development, the development of the political system, the structure of State and local authorities, [or] human rights, for the purpose of influencing State policy, the structure of State and local authorities, or their decisions and actions.The above activity may be carried out in the following ways:organising and holding public events such as meetings, rallies, demonstrations, marches or pickets, or any combination of them, and organising and holding public debates, discussions, or speeches;attempting to obtain specific outcomes in elections or referenda, acting as an election or referendum observer, establishing election or referendum commissions, engaging in the activities of political parties;submitting public petitions to State and local authorities and officials, and performing other actions affecting [such public authorities and officials], including actions encouraging the adoption, amendment or repeal of laws or other legal acts;disseminating, including via information networks, views on State authorities’ decisions and policy;shaping opinion on social and political issues by, in particular, organising public opinion polls and publishing the results, or conducting sociological research;involving citizens, including minors, in the above activities;financing the above activities.The activities in the following fields shall be excluded from the scope of ‘political activity’: science, culture, the arts, healthcare, the prevention of disease and the protection of health, social security, the protection of motherhood and childhood, the social support of disabled persons, the promotion of a healthy lifestyle, physical well‑being and sports, the protection of flora and fauna, charity work.”Restrictions applicable to “foreign-agent” organisations29.  On 4 November 2014 Law no. 344-FZ established a simplified form of book-keeping which may be used by all non-commercial organisations with the exception of “foreign-agent” organisations (sections 6(4)(2) and 6(5)(12) of the Accounting Act, Law no. 402-FZ of 6 December 2011).30.  On 24 November 2014 Law no. 355-FZ amended the Political Parties Act (Law no. 95-FZ of 11 July 2001) to prohibit political parties from receiving donations from, or entering into transactions with, Russian “foreign-agent” organisations (sections 30(3) and 31(4.1)).31.  It also amended the Elections and Referenda Act (Law no. 67-FZ of 12 June 2002) to establish that Russian NGOs which had been categorised as “foreign agents” could not take part in electoral campaigning or referenda in any form, along with foreign entities and individuals. It specifically prohibited such organisations from promoting or opposing candidates or lists of candidates in an election, initiating a referendum or campaigning for a referendum, working towards a specific outcome in an election or participating in the monitoring of an election or referendum, except in the capacity of a “foreign (international) observer” (section 3.6). “Foreign-agent” Russian organisations were also prohibited, alongside foreign individuals and entities, from making contributions to the electoral fund of a candidate in an election or the fund of a referendum.32.  The State Duma Election Act (Law no. 20-FZ of 22 February 2014) and the Presidential Election Act (Law no. 19-FZ of 10 January 2003) were brought into line with the Elections and Referenda Act to prevent Russian “foreign-agent” organisations from in any way taking part in the preparation of an election, electoral campaigning, or the financing of an election.33.  On 3 July 2016 Law no. 287-FZ created a new category of non‑commercial organisations which were “providers of socially useful services”. Such non-commercial organisations were eligible for priority funding at federal and regional levels (section 31.1 of the NCO Act). Section 2(2.2) of the NCO Act explicitly provided that “foreign-agent” organisations could not be recognised as “providers of socially useful services”.34.  Law no. 203-FZ of 19 July 2018 amended section 10(3) of the Public Monitoring Boards (Penal Facilities) Act (Law no. 76-FZ of 10 June 2008) to prohibit “foreign-agent” organisations from nominating candidates to public monitoring boards.35.  Law no. 362-FZ of 11 October 2018 added section 5(1.1) to the Anti‑corruption Assessment Act (Law no. 172-FZ of 17 July 2009), excluding Russian organisations with the status of a “foreign agent” from the list of civil society institutions entitled to carry out independent anti‑corruption assessment of draft legislation.Constitutional Court36.  On 8 April 2014 the Constitutional Court affirmed the constitutional validity of the provisions of the Foreign Agents Act (Ruling no. 10-P) and provided an interpretation of the term “foreign agent”.37.  Firstly, it set out which circumstances should be considered when determining whether an organisation was financed from abroad:“... There is no risk of arbitrary interpretation and application of the provisions on foreign funding, as it makes no difference for how long, in what amount or in what form foreign funds have been provided. However, it is important to bear in mind that relevant funds and other property should be not only transferred (remitted) to the non‑commercial organisation, but also received by it; if it refuses to receive them and returns them to the foreign source, in particular before starting political activity, the organisation is not obliged to file an application for registration as a foreign agent ...”38.  It further described what actions constituted political activity:“The forms of political activity can be diverse. In addition to meetings, rallies, demonstrations, marches and pickets, political actions may include: elections and referendum campaigns; public appeals to State bodies; the dissemination of positions regarding decisions made and the policy pursued by State bodies, including dissemination via information networks; and other activities which cannot be exhaustively listed. When classifying as political actions some activities organised and carried out with the participation of non-commercial organisations ... it is important to determine how they may affect (either directly or by influencing public opinion) the decision-making process of State bodies and State policy, and also to determine whether they will trigger a public reaction and attract the attention of State bodies or civil society.The activities of a non-commercial organisation in such fields as science, culture, the arts, public health, preventive care and healthcare, social support and protection, the protection of motherhood and childhood, the social support of disabled persons, the promotion of a healthy lifestyle, physical exercise and sports, the protection of flora and fauna, charitable activities, and aid to charities and voluntary organisations shall not be considered political activity ... even if the aim of these activities is to influence the decision-making process of State bodies and State policy, provided that this aim stays within the limits of the relevant field ...”39.  When defining whether an organisation intends to carry out political activities, it is necessary to consider the following elements:“... if [a non-commercial organisation’s members] participate in political activity on their own behalf and on their own initiative, in particular, in breach of instructions provided by this organisation (its management bodies or officials), [the provisions] of the Foreign Agents Act do not apply ...... The intention to participate in political activity in the territory of the Russian Federation may be confirmed by: the constituent documents, mission statement or other official documents of a non-commercial organisation; public statements by its directors (officials) containing an appeal to adopt, change or annul some decisions by State bodies; notices of assemblies, meetings, demonstrations, marches or pickets sent by a non-commercial organisation to a regional executive or municipal body; the preparation and presentation of legislative initiatives; and other public activities objectively demonstrating that the non-commercial organisation intends to arrange and hold political events in order to influence the decision-making process of State bodies and State policy.”40.  The Constitutional Court held that the sanctions in the CAO were compliant with the Constitution, except for the provision establishing the minimum amounts of fines in Article 19.34 of the CAO, in so far as it prevented courts from giving due consideration to the nature of the offence, the extent to which the defendant was liable for the offence, the property and financial status of the defendant, and other elements which were relevant for meting out an individualised punishment:“4.2. ... It becomes extremely difficult and sometimes impossible to ensure, as the Constitution requires, an individual approach to imposing an administrative fine whose minimum amount is 100,000 roubles for officials and 300,000 roubles for legal entities, especially because no alternative is provided for.... Thus, the provision ... that establishes the minimum amount of the administrative fine ... does not conform to the Constitution of the Russian Federation...5. ... pending the relevant amendments ..., the court may reduce the amount of the fine below the minimum amount ...if the amount of the fine as provided for by [the CAO] is not in line with the purpose of administrative punishment and obviously results in the excessive limitation of the offender’s property rights.6. The court decisions on the cases of [Public Initiatives Support Centre] and Mr Zamaryanov ... shall be reviewed if ... they were based on Article 19.34 § 1 of the CAO ... ”LEGAL MATERIAL REFERRED TO BY THE PARTIES41.  This section contains extracts from legal instruments to which the parties referred in their submissions.Fundamental Principles on the Status of Non-governmental Organisations in Europe and Explanatory Memorandum, Strasbourg, 13 November 2002, and Recommendation CM/Rec(2007)14 of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers to member states on the legal status of non‑governmental organisations in Europe (10 October 2007)42.  NGOs may solicit and receive funding – cash or donations in kind – from another country, multilateral agencies or an institutional or individual donor, subject to generally applicable foreign exchange and customs laws (Point 50 of the Fundamental Principles and Committee of Ministers Recommendation). The possibility for NGOs to solicit donations in cash or in kind is a fundamental principle, a natural consequence of their non‑profit‑making nature. Such contributions, along with the proceeds of any economic activity, are an NGO’s vital means of financing the pursuit of its objectives. However, this possibility for NGOs to collect funding is not absolute and may be subject to regulation, with a view to protecting the target audience (point 56 of the Explanatory Memorandum).43.  In the spirit of transparency and accountability, NGOs should submit an annual report to their members and directors. Such reports can also be required to be submitted to a designated supervising body, where any taxation privileges or other public support has been granted to the NGOs concerned. In particular, relevant books, records and activities of NGOs may, where specified by law or by contract, be subject to inspection by a supervising agency. NGOs should generally have their accounts audited by an institution or person independent of their management (points 60-65 of the Fundamental Principles and points 62-66 of the Committee of Ministers Recommendation).The United States Foreign Agents Registration Act44.  The Foreign Agents Registration Act (“the FARA Act”) of 1938 (52 Stat. 631-633), a US law as amended in 1942 and 1966 (22 U.S.C. §§ 611-621), was originally adopted to require that agents representing the interests of foreign powers in a “political or quasi-political capacity” disclose their relationship with the foreign government, so that “the government and the American people” could evaluate “the statements and activities of such persons”. In 1966 the Act was amended to target agents actually working with foreign powers who sought economic or political advantage by influencing governmental decision-making. The amendments shifted the focus of the law from propaganda to political lobbying and narrowed the meaning of “foreign agent”. The current text provides: “§ 611. DefinitionsAs used in and for the purposes of this subchapter—...(b) The term ‘foreign principal’ includes—(1) a government of a foreign country and a foreign political party;(2) a person outside of the United States ...; and(3) a partnership, association, corporation, organisation, or other combination of persons organised under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a foreign country.(c) Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the term ‘agent of a foreign principal’ means –(1) any person who acts as an agent, representative, employee, or servant, or any person who acts in any other capacity at the order, request, or under the direction or control, of a foreign principal or of a person any of whose activities are directly or indirectly supervised, directed, controlled, financed, or subsidized in whole or in major part by a foreign principal, and who directly or through any other person –(i) engages within the United States in political activities for or in the interests of such foreign principal;(ii) acts within the United States as a public relations counsel, publicity agent, information-service employee or political consultant for or in the interests of such foreign principal;(iii) within the United States solicits, collects, disburses, or dispenses contributions, loans, money, or other things of value for or in the interest of such foreign principal; or(iv) within the United States represents the interests of such foreign principal before any agency or official of the Government of the United States; and(2) any person who agrees, consents, assumes or purports to act as, or who is or holds himself out to be, whether or not pursuant to contractual relationship, an agent of a foreign principal as defined in clause (1) of this subsection....(o) The term ‘political activities’ means any activity that the person engaging in believes will, or that the person intends to, in any way influence any agency or official of the Government of the United States or any section of the public within the United States with reference to formulating, adopting, or changing the domestic or foreign policies of the United States or with reference to the political or public interests, policies, or relations of a government of a foreign country or a foreign political party ...”Hungary’s Transparency Act45.  Hungary’s Act no. LXXVI of 2017 on the Transparency of Organisations Financed from Abroad (“the Transparency Act”) required associations and foundations (except for sport and religious associations), political parties and ethnic minority associations to apply to be on a special register if the foreign funding part of their budget exceeded 7,200,000 Hungarian forints (HUF – approximately EUR 22,100) annually, under the threat of fines or dissolution. Organisations financed from abroad were subject to additional labelling and reporting requirements.46.  The Act was repealed in April 2021 following a finding by the Court of Justice of the European Union (Grand Chamber) that it was contrary to EU law (see judgment of 18 June 2020, Commission v Hungary (Transparency of associations), C‑78/18, EU:C:2020:476). The Court held in particular that the objective of increasing the transparency of the financing of associations, although legitimate, cannot justify the introduction of legislation based on a presumption – made on principle and applied indiscriminately – that any financial support paid by a non-national natural or legal person, and any civil society organisation receiving such financial support, were intrinsically liable to jeopardise the State’s political and economic interests and the ability of its institutions to operate free from interference (§ 86). As concerns the grounds of public policy or public security, the Court found that the financial thresholds triggering the application of the obligations put in place by the Transparency Act were fixed at amounts which clearly did not appear to correspond with the scenario of a sufficiently serious threat to a fundamental interest of society which those obligations are supposed to prevent (§ 94).47.  The Court further considered that the obligations put in place by Transparency Act constituted limitations on the right to freedom of association, inasmuch as they rendered significantly more difficult the operation of the targeted associations because of the dissuasive effect of such obligations and the penalties attached to any failure to comply with them (§§ 115-16). Second, the systematic obligations imposed on the associations and foundations to register and present themselves under the designation “organisation in receipt of support from abroad” were also liable to have a deterrent effect on the participation of non-national donors in the financing of civil society and thus to hinder the activities of those organisations and the achievement of the aims which they pursue. Those obligations were furthermore of such a nature as to create a generalised climate of mistrust vis‑à-vis the associations and foundations at issue, in Hungary, and to stigmatise them (§§ 118-19). The Court referred to its finding above that there was no justification for the introduction of those additional obligations (§ 140).Israel’s Disclosure Act48.  Israel’s Act on Disclosure Requirements for Recipients of Support from a Foreign State Entity (Statute book 5771-2011, 2 March 2011) establishes that an organisation which has received more than 50% of its funding from a foreign State or inter-State organisation must submit to the Ministry of Justice an online form specifying the identity of the donor, the amount of support received and the designation of the support, and the conditions under which the support was granted, including undertakings given by the recipient of the support to a foreign State entity. Additionally, an NGO that has received a donation from a foreign entity for the purpose of funding a special advertising campaign must publish, as part of its campaign, the fact that it has received the donation.RELEVANT LEGAL MATERIAL49.  This section sets out legal assessments of the Foreign Agents Act and its effect on Russian NGOs.Intergovernmental organisations and advisory bodiesThe Venice Commission50.  On 27 June 2014 the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission) reached the following conclusions concerning the Foreign Agents Act (CDL-AD(2014)025).“132.  ... The use of the term ‘foreign agent’ is highly controversial. By bringing back the rhetoric used during the communist period, this term stigmatises the NCOs to which it is applied, tarnishing their reputation and seriously hampering their activities. The Venice Commission therefore recommends that the term be abandoned.133.  The Venice Commission further considers that the legitimate aim of ensuring transparency of NCOs receiving funding from abroad cannot justify measures which hamper the activities of NCOs operating in the field of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. It therefore recommends reconsidering the creation of a special regime with autonomous registration, special register and a host of additional legal obligations.134.  If this specific legal regime is maintained, the power of the authorities to proceed with the registration of a NCO as ‘foreign agent’ (or other term) without that NCO’s consent should be removed ...135.  Pursuant to the law under examination, the legal status of a foreign agent presupposes not only that a NCO receives foreign funding but also that it participates in ‘political activities’. This expression is however quite broad and vague and the practice of its interpretation by public authorities has been so far rather disparate, adding to the uncertainties surrounding the meaning of the term. The Venice Commission therefore calls upon the Russian authorities to work towards a clear definition of ‘political activities’...136.  In addition to its text, the practical implementation of the Law on Non‑Commercial Organisations also gives rise to concerns. Reports indicate that NCOs have been subject to numerous extraordinary inspections, with the legal ground of these inspections remaining unclear and the extent of documents required during them differing quite substantively.”Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe51.  On 15 July 2013 the Commissioner issued an Opinion on the Legislation of the Russian Federation on Non-Commercial Organisations in light of Council of Europe Standards. The Commissioner stated that the term “foreign agent” carried with it a connotation of ostracism or stigma, that the definition of “political activity” was broad and vague, and that the legislation regulating the activities of NGOs in Russia should be revised, with the aim of establishing a clear, coherent and consistent framework in line with applicable international standards. Reporting and accounting requirements should be the same for all NGOs, regardless of the sources of their income. They should be transparent and coherent and not interfere with NGOs’ ongoing work. There should be no more than one governmental institution dealing with issues such as registering, reporting, regulating and overseeing the work of the NGOs. Other agencies should exercise their supervisory powers only in cases where there were reasonable and objective grounds to believe that the organisation in question had violated its legal obligations.52.  On 9 July 2015 an update was issued, entitled “Legislation and Practice in the Russian Federation on Non‑Commercial Organisations in light of Council of Europe Standards: an Update”. The Commissioner analysed the domestic case-law and found that there had been at least 189 cases brought before first‑instance and appellate domestic courts in respect of the application of the legislation on “foreign agents”. Of those, at least twenty‑eight judicial decisions had been delivered in favour of the NGOs concerned, while at least 121 judicial decisions had found that the law had been correctly applied against the NGOs. In at least fifty-five of the cases, the judicial decisions had already become enforceable. As a result of the application of the legislation on “foreign agents”, at least twenty NGOs had ceased their activity either in full (for example, by terminating their operations voluntarily or suspending their activity) or in part (for example, by stopping specific projects). The Commissioner further noted that the recommendations in the previous Opinion had not been implemented, and made the following recommendations:“The Commissioner calls on the Russian authorities to revise the legislation on non‑commercial organisations in order to establish a clear, coherent and consistent framework in line with applicable European and international standards ... In particular, the legislative revision should entail:the use of clear definitions in the legislation allowing to foresee the legal consequences of its implementation;avoiding the use of stigmatising language such as ‘foreign agent’ towards NCOs;non-discriminatory legal provisions, including in the field of reporting and sanctioning of NCOs, irrespective of the sources of their funding;application of the ‘pressing social need’ criteria for any State interference with the freedoms of association and expression, including the imposition of sanctions;limiting State interference in NCO activities to setting up clear and non‑biased standards of transparency and reporting;application of sanctions only as measures of the last resort in full compliance with the principle of proportionality;revocation of provisions establishing criminal prosecution of NCO staff in cases which normally fall under administrative procedures.”United Nations(a)   The right of access to funding53.  The UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders (General Assembly Resolution 53/144 of 8 March 1999) provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to solicit, receive and utilize resources for the express purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms through peaceful means in accordance with Article 3 of the present Declaration” (Article 13). The right of access to funding is to be exercised within the juridical framework of domestic legislation – provided that such legislation is consistent with international human rights standards.54.  The UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief (General Assembly Resolution 36/55 of 25 November 1981) indicates that the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief shall include, in particular, the freedom “to solicit and receive voluntary financial and other contributions from individuals and institutions” (Article 6 (f)).55.  The Human Rights Council’s Resolution 22/6 on protecting human‑rights defenders (21 March 2013) urged the States “to acknowledge publicly the important and legitimate role of human rights defenders ... by respecting the independence of their organizations and by avoiding the stigmatization of their work” and “to ensure that reporting requirements placed on [associations] do not inhibit functional autonomy”, that “restrictions are not discriminatorily imposed on potential sources of funding”, and that “no law should criminalize or delegitimize activities in defence of human rights on account of the geographic origin of funding thereto” (A/HRC/RES/22/6, §§ 5 and 9).(b)   Assessment of the Foreign Agents Act’s compatibility with Russia’s obligations under UN treaties56.  In its concluding observations on the seventh periodic report of the Russian Federation on the observance of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights dated 31 March 2015, the Human Rights Committee determined that the Russian Federation should, “at the very least”, remove the term “foreign agent” from the law, clarify the broad definition of “political activities”, remove the power granted under the law to register non‑commercial organisations without their consent, and revisit the procedural requirements and sanctions applicable under the law to ensure their necessity and proportionality (CCPR/C/RUS/7/CO).  Similar concerns were expressed by the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, following consideration of the sixth periodic report of the Russian Federation. The Committee called on the Russian Government to, among other things, repeal the legislative provisions introduced by the Foreign Agents Act and create a safe and supportive environment for the work of NGOs and human rights defenders (E/C.12/RUS/CO/6, §§ 7-8, 16 October 2017).57.  In its concluding remarks on the sixth periodic report of the Russian Federation dated 28 August 2018, the Committee against Torture expressed the view that the “foreign-agent” legislation was often used as a means of administrative harassment against human rights organisations, forcing them to reduce and eventually cease their activities (CAT/C/RUS/CO/6, paragraph 28). It also expressed concern about a revision of rules on the composition of prison monitoring boards which had resulted in the exclusion of independent monitors (paragraph 22).Non-governmental organisationsAmnesty International58.  A report released by Amnesty International in November 2016 entitled “Agents of the people: Four years of ‘foreign agents’ law in Russia” highlighted the negative impact of the Foreign Agents Act on independent Russian NGOs.59.  Amnesty International noted that the Russian authorities had implemented the Foreign Agents Act in such a way that almost any NGO which received foreign funds was likely to be registered as a “foreign agent”, irrespective of its activities. The Foreign Agents Act had been used to undermine and discredit effective and active NGOs. It had contributed to the creation of an atmosphere of suspicion and intolerance. Many organisations which had made a significant contribution to the promotion of human rights, civil society and well-being had been forced to close down.60.  NGOs faced a difficult choice: to accept funds from abroad and be labelled “foreign agents”, or to refuse foreign funding and rely exclusively on Russian sources, including presidential grants or grants from local authorities. However, NGOs funded by the Government might become less independent and more prone to self-censorship.61.  Amnesty International recommended suspending and then repealing the Foreign Agents Act; publicly acknowledging the importance of NGOs in civil society; and protecting NGOs and human rights defenders against harassment and attacks.Human Rights Resource Centre62.  “‘Foreign Agents’: Mythical Enemies and Russian Society’s Real Losses”, a research report released in March 2015 by the Human Rights Resource Centre, an information and legal services organisation for Russian NGOs in St Petersburg, reviewed cases where organisations had involuntarily been put on the register of foreign agents. The researchers concluded that the legislation on “foreign agents” had made the situation of NGOs worse. The domestic courts had adopted a very wide interpretation of the Foreign Agents Act by extending the term “political activity” to include activities useful to society, the dissemination of information and the protection of human rights. This had resulted in a prejudicial attitude towards NGOs which had an active position in society and implemented projects helping to deal with social problems. This had also resulted in pressure being put on public leaders, impeding the leaders’ activities and the daily work of NGOs.63.  The researchers identified seventy grounds for classifying activities as “political”, including activities that had taken place before the Foreign Agents Act had been adopted: organising educational campaigns, events, conferences, and seminars; posting information on the Internet about a speech by a “foreign-agent” organisation’s director; collecting signatures; signing petitions in support of an environmental activist; expressing an intention to participate in public events; a “foreign-agent” organisation’s members participating in events abroad; “foreign-agent” organisations’ directors being involved in public monitoring bodies in their personal capacity; publishing information and preparing reports on human rights; supporting NGOs; submitting an expert opinion to the Constitutional Court; the expert assessment of laws; publishing a report on activities on a “foreign-agent” organisation’s website; financing an NGO; donating books to a library; releasing films; distributing flyers; posting information online on events organised by NGOs; NGOs organising events in the office of a “foreign-agent” organisation; making recommendations to State authorities; participating in the activities of NGOs; organising a teleconference between Moscow and Tbilisi; publishing an analysis of Russian law on a website and criticising Russian law and authorities; holding meetings with politicians; allowing third parties to speak at an event organised by a “foreign-agent” organisation; sharing information on a personal account on social media; providing legal assistance to activists; awarding prizes; scientific research; and posting information about a “foreign-agent” organisation on a third party’s website. In most cases, the activities did not concern any political issues. The researchers concluded that any actions of NGOs could be identified as political activity. The indication in the Foreign Agents Act that NGOs’ activities in science, the protection of flora and fauna and other fields could not be considered political activity had not changed the situation.Centre for Economic and Politic Reform64.  In December 2015 the Centre for Economic and Political Reform, an online platform for independent experts, released the findings of research into the allocation of presidential grants to NGOs. It found that financial support for NGOs aligned with the State had increased manyfold after the enactment of the Foreign Agents Act. Between 2013 and 2015 the largest beneficiaries of presidential grants had included the Russian Orthodox Church and its affiliated organisations; proponents of “Eurasianism” – a domestically grown “third way” ideology with strong anti-Western overtones; Kremlin-aligned youth organisations, such as the Russian Youth Union (RSM); various NGOs active in the annexed region of Crimea, and “pet projects” of State leaders, such as Prime Minister Medvedev’s Lawyers’ Association of Russia, and President Putin’s Night Hockey League and a bikers’ club he patronised. The report concluded that the financial support system served the interests of the State rather than those of civil society. In addition, in the absence of reporting requirements, most projects, in particular online projects, had never been implemented.THE LAWMATTERS OF PROCEDUREJoinder of the applications65.  Having regard to the similar subject matter of the applications, the Court finds it appropriate to examine them jointly in a single judgment.Procedural succession in respect of the applicant organisations which have ceased to exist66.  In order to consider the issue of succession in the cases of the applicant organisations that have ceased to exist, the Court asked the applicants to indicate whether any natural or legal persons had declared their intention to continue the proceedings in those cases. The applicants provided information on the founders, former directors, members and participants in the dissolved or liquidated applicant organisations who had expressed a wish to pursue the proceedings in their stead. This information was sent to the Government for comment and included in the relevant parts of the Appendix.67.  The Government submitted that the fact that some applicant organisations went into voluntary dissolution because of their “unwillingness to adapt to the existing legal realities” of the foreign-agent legislation could not be a valid ground for recognising a violation of their rights or for continuing the Convention proceedings after their dissolution. Other applicant organisations had been liquidated for non-compliance with the legislation on non-commercial organisations, including violations of reporting and accounting requirements. Their liquidation was not the result of any pressure from State authorities.68.  When ruling on the matter of procedural succession, the Court is not called upon to decide whether there has been an interference with the applicants’ Convention rights which was attributable to the State or whether it was justified. The issue is a narrow one: whether the persons who expressed a wish to pursue the proceedings before the Court in relation to the applications lodged by the applicant associations that ceased to exist have standing to continue the proceedings in their stead. The Court reiterates that in determining this matter the decisive point is not whether the rights in question are transferable to the persons wishing to pursue the procedure, but whether the proposed successors can in principle claim a legitimate interest in requesting the Court to deal with the case on the basis of the applicant’s wish to exercise the right to lodge an individual application with the Court. Also, human rights cases before the Court generally have a moral dimension which it must take into account when considering whether to continue with the examination of an application after an applicant has ceased to exist. This is all the more so when the issues raised by the case transcend the person and the interests of an individual applicant, as the Court’s judgments serve not only to decide those cases brought before it but, more generally, to elucidate, safeguard and develop the rules instituted by the Convention, thereby contributing to the States’ observance of the engagements undertaken by them (see Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, §§ 78-79, ECHR 2005‑XII (extracts)).69.  The Court reiterates that dissolution of an association affects both the association itself and also its presidents, founders and members (see Jehovah’s Witnesses of Moscow and Others v. Russia, no. 302/02, § 101, 10 June 2010, with further references). It follows that former directors and members of a dissolved or liquidated applicant association have a legitimate personal interest in requesting the Court to consider that association’s complaint stemming from the allegation that its liquidation or dissolution had been a result of pressure which the State authorities had brought to bear on it. In addition, the issues raised in the present case transcend the interests of individual applicants concerning, as they do, the fundamental ability of non‑governmental organisation to function without undue interference from the State authorities. One of the central complaints in the present case is that by introducing new restrictive measures and burdensome requirements the State authorities were seeking to make it difficult or impossible for the applicant associations to continue their work as “public watchdogs”. Not considering the merits of the complaints merely on the basis that the applicant associations ceased to exist through voluntary dissolution or forced liquidation would defeat the purpose of their application to the Court (compare Uniya OOO and Belcourt Trading Company v. Russia, nos. 4437/03 and 13290/03, § 264, 19 June 2014).70.  Accordingly, the Court decides that the former chairpersons, presidents, founders, directors and members of the applicant associations that ceased to exist – whose names and titles are given in the Appendix – have standing to pursue the applications lodged by those associations.ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 10 AND 11 OF THE CONVENTION71.  The applicants complained that the statutory requirements introduced by the “foreign-agent” legislation and the practice of its application amounted to unforeseeable and excessive restrictions on their freedom of expression and association under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention, the relevant parts of which read as follows:Article 10“1.  Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority ...2.  The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others ...”Article 11“1.  Everyone has the right to freedom ... of association with others ...2.  No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others...”72.  Given that the implementation of the principle of pluralism is impossible without an association being able to express freely its ideas and opinions, the Court has recognised that the protection of opinions and the freedom of expression within the meaning of Article 10 of the Convention is one of the objectives of the freedom of association (see Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, § 91, ECHR 2004‑I, and Parti nationaliste basque – Organisation régionale d’Iparralde v. France, no. 71251/01, § 33, ECHR 2007‑II). Such a link is particularly relevant where – as in these cases – the authorities’ intervention against an association was, at least in part, in reaction to its views and statements (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v. Bulgaria, nos. 29221/95 and 29225/95, § 85, ECHR 2001‑IX, and The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 59491/00, § 59, 19 January 2006). The Court will therefore examine the present cases under Article 11 interpreted in the light of Article 10.AdmissibilityExhaustion of domestic remedies73.  The Government raised a twofold non-exhaustion objection. They submitted that the Levada Centre, the Human Rights Academy, the Southern Human Rights Centre, the Chapayevsk Medical Association, Mr Sergeyev, the Centre for Social and Labour Rights, Legal Mission, the School of the Conscript, the Sova Centre, Mr Yukechev and Tak-Tak-Tak had not applied for further review of the decisions in the administrative-offence cases after they had become enforceable. The Government also claimed that some applicants had not applied for a judicial review of the Ministry of Justice’s decision on their registration as “foreign agents”.74.  As regards the first limb of the objection, the applicants relied on the Court’s case-law, indicating that the procedure for reviewing the administrative-offence decisions under Article 30.12 of the CAO was not an effective remedy. As regards the second limb, they pointed out that they had all been given fines under Article 19.34 of the CAO for their alleged failure to register as “foreign agents”, and that their appeals against those decisions had been rejected.75.  The Court agrees with the applicants. The review procedure under Article 30.12 of the CAO is not an effective remedy which needs to be exhausted (see Smadikov v. Russia (dec.), no. 10810/15, § 49, 31 January 2017). The applicant organisations also went through the chain of appeals in the proceedings in which they had been found liable for failing to seek registration as “foreign agents”. The applicant organisations’ inclusion in the register of “foreign agents” was sufficient evidence of interference, irrespective of any further action taken against them by the Ministry of Justice. The Government’s objection is accordingly rejected.Victim status76.  The Government considered that the complaints by some applicants were inadmissible ratione personae because they lacked status as “victims” of the alleged violations. In their submission, the Moscow Helsinki Group, the Democratic Centre, ADC Memorial and Coming Out could not claim to be “victims” because they had never been registered as “foreign agents”. Some other applicants had lost their status as “victims” of the alleged violations on account of subsequent developments. The first group of such applicants, including the Humanist Youth Movement, Maximum Centre, Perm-36, Baikal Wave, the Committee against Torture and Golos-Povolzhye, had gone into voluntary dissolution to avoid paying fines. A second group made up of sixteen or more applicant organisations had been removed from the register of foreign agents. In the cases of the Golos Association and Ms Shibanova, the decisions by which they had been deemed non-compliant and fined had been reversed, and the fines had been reimbursed.77.  The applicants pointed out that, in accordance with the Court’s case‑law, an individual who was confronted with the choice of either modifying his or her conduct or accepting a restriction on his or her rights might claim to be a “victim” of the alleged violation, even in the absence of a specific instance of the impugned legislation being enforced. Despite the fact that some of the organisations had not been fined, and that some restrictive measures had been cancelled or not applied, they could still claim to be “victims” of the alleged violations, as they remained under the threat of registration as a “foreign agent” or the imposition of sanctions under the Foreign Agents Act. In order to avert that risk, they had to refuse foreign funding and significantly reduce the scope of their activities, or take decisions on voluntary dissolution, being unable to secure alternative funding from Russian sources. The Moscow Helsinki Group emphasised that it had implemented staff cuts, cancelled annual human-rights training courses and scaled down human-rights monitoring activities in Russian regions. The Democratic Centre had been targeted by a prosecutor’s warning advising it that it was potentially not complying with the Foreign Agents Act. Having refused foreign funding, it had had to stop paying office rent and salaries. Lastly, ADC Memorial and Coming Out had gone into liquidation, anticipating the Ministry of Justice’s decision to put them on the register of foreign agents.78.  The Court will join the Government’s objection as to the applicants’ status as “victims” of the alleged violations to the merits of the case. In the absence of any other grounds for inadmissibility, this part of the application must therefore be declared admissible.MeritsExistence of interference78.  The applicants submitted that by making them register as “foreign agents”, using the stigmatising label of a “foreign agent”, restricting their access to foreign funding, subjecting them to numerous inspections and fines and excessive accounting requirements, and imposing on them the obligation to label their publications as originating from a “foreign agent”, the Russian authorities had interfered with their right to freedom of expression and association.79.  The Government submitted that the obligation to register as a “foreign agent” established in the Foreign Agents Act did not prohibit or restrict the applicant organisations’ ability to engage in free debate and political activities in Russia and to express their ideas. There had therefore been no interference with their right to freedom of expression and association under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.80.  The Court reiterates that persons or NGOs may claim to be victims of a violation if they are members of a group at risk of being directly affected by legislation. Even in the absence of an individual measure of implementation, an applicant may nevertheless argue that a law breaches his or her rights in the absence of a specific instance of enforcement, and thus claim to be a “victim”, within the meaning of Article 34, if he or she is required either to modify his or her conduct or risk being prosecuted for failure to comply with the law (see Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, § 34, ECHR 2008, and S.A.S. v. France [GC], no. 43835/11, § 57, ECHR 2014 (extracts)).81.  Interference with the right to freedom of association can take a variety of forms, such as: requiring an existing association to submit to new registration procedures (see Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army v. Russia, no. 72881/01, § 73, ECHR 2006‑XI); conducting inspections which have the effect of inhibiting an organisation’s activities and imposing sanctions (see Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi v. Turkey, no. 19920/13, §§ 71-72, 26 April 2016 (extracts)); using objectionable terms to describe an association (see Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others v. Germany, no. 58911/00, § 84, 6 November 2008); imposing a prohibition on the foreign financing of a political party (see Parti nationaliste basque – Organisation régionale d’Iparralde, cited above, §§ 37-38); or causing an association to go into dissolution (see Freedom and Democracy Party (ÖZDEP) v. Turkey [GC], no. 23885/94, §§ 26-27, ECHR 1999‑VIII, and Tebieti Mühafize Cemiyyeti and Israfilov v. Azerbaijan, no. 37083/03, § 54, ECHR 2009).82.  The Court observes that, prior to the enactment of the “foreign-agent” legislation, many applicant organisations had existed for a considerable period of time, and some of them – the Moscow Helsinki Group, the Memorial Human Rights Centre, the Movement For Human Rights, and Citizens’ Watch – had been legally established as early as the 1990s, in the wake of a democratic transition in Russia. They had received funding from a variety of sources, including individual and institutional donors, both domestic and international.83.  Following the enactment of the Foreign Agents Act, all the applicant organisations were subjected to unscheduled inspections on the part of the regulatory and law-enforcement authorities which sought to determine the sources of their financing and the scope of their activities (see paragraph 18 above). The inspections interfered with the operation of the applicant organisations, in so far as they took a long time and involved: repeated visits from prosecutors and officials from justice departments; the questioning of the applicant organisations’ staff; and requests that the organisations produce large numbers of documents covering several years of activities, including charter and financial documentation, information about events organised by the applicant organisations, and other documents relating to their mission. Failure to comply with the requests for documentation was punishable by substantial fines (see paragraph 24 above). The Court has already found that such burdensome requirements which have the effect of inhibiting an organisation’s activities may, in themselves, amount to an interference with the right to freedom of association (see Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi, cited above, § 71, and Jehovah’s Witnesses of Moscow and Others, cited above, § 176).84.  Once the domestic authorities determined that the applicant organisations had engaged in “political activities” and received “foreign financing” within the meaning of the Foreign Agents Act, the organisations were given fines for failing to seek registration as “foreign agents” (see paragraphs 24 above and 355 and 514 below). They were also confronted with a choice between accepting the label of a “foreign agent”, or continuing their work outside the confines of the Foreign Agents Act by rejecting any donations considered to be “foreign financing” (see paragraph 500 below). If they chose the former option, registration as a “foreign agent” entailed additional accounting, auditing, reporting and labelling requirements (see paragraphs 19, 20 and 21 above). The latter scenario involved a reduction in their budget. The financial difficulties following such a decision resulted in staff cuts and the freezing of projects. Both options required a significant adjustment on the part of an organisation as regards conduct, which amounted to interference with its right to freedom of association. Moreover, the case of the Movement For Human Rights – an organisation which was initially deleted from the register of foreign agents in 2015 before being reinstated in 2019 (see paragraph 513 below) – demonstrated that even organisations which sought to modify their conduct in compliance with the Foreign Agents Act continually faced the risk of being deemed non‑compliant and incurring sanctions.85.  Some applicant organisations, including ADC Memorial and the LGBT organisation Coming Out, went into dissolution, fearing that they would be unable to pay fines and secure alternative funding for their core activities. The inspections, sanctions and other restrictions in respect of those organisations eventually resulted in their ceasing to exist as legal persons. The Court reiterates that, to the extent that leaders and members of an association resolve to dissolve their organisation in the hope of avoiding adverse effects of domestic legislation or actions by the domestic authorities, such decisions cannot be said to have been made freely, as they should be if they are to be recognised under Article 11 (see Freedom and Democracy Party (ÖZDEP), cited above, § 26; see also, on continuing proceedings in the cases of organisations which have been dissolved, OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v. Russia (dec.), no. 14902/04, § 443, 29 January 2009, and Zhdanov and Others v. Russia, nos. 12200/08 and 2 others, § 115, 16 July 2019). Dissolution of an association, whether effected by its members under duress or ordered by the domestic authorities – as it was, for instance, in the case of the Golos Association (see paragraph 354 below) – amounts to interference with the right to freedom of association.86.  Lastly, in so far as the individual applicants – the directors of applicant organisations – are concerned, the interference with their rights resulted from the decisions by which they were fined for failing to file applications to register their organisations as “foreign agents”. Moreover, where an applicant organisation was dissolved out of necessity or on the orders of the authorities, the act of dissolution also interfered with the exercise of the right to freedom of association by its directors and members (see the cases of the Golos Association, Fund 19/29, and the Democratic Centre).87.  In sum, the Court finds that the applicant organisations and their directors have been directly affected by a combination of inspections, new registration requirements, sanctions and restrictions on sources of funding and the nature of the activities which were imposed by the Foreign Agents Act. They had to alter their conduct significantly to reduce the risk of facing further penalties under the Act, which, however, did not stop the authorities from issuing further fines while they were on the register of “foreign agents”. Those measures resulted in the dissolution of some applicant organisations. There has therefore been interference with the applicants’ right to freedom of association under Article 11 of the Convention, interpreted in the light of Article 10. The Court also rejects the Government’s objection as to the applicants’ status as “victims” of the alleged violations.Justification for the interference(a)   General principles88.  While in the context of Article 11 the Court has often referred to the essential role played by political parties in ensuring pluralism and democracy, associations formed for other purposes are also important to the proper functioning of democracy. For pluralism is also built on the genuine recognition of, and respect for, diversity and the dynamics of cultural traditions, ethnic and cultural identities, religious beliefs, artistic, literary and socio-economic ideas and concepts. The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively (see Gorzelik and Others, cited above, § 92, and Zhdanov and Others, cited above, § 139).(b)    “Prescribed by law”89.  The Court will firstly examine whether the measures taken against the applicants can be said to have been “in accordance with the law”. The interference had its statutory basis in the provisions of the Foreign Agents Act, which established a framework regulation applicable to Russian non‑commercial organisations that were deemed to receive “foreign financing” and engage in “political activities”.90.  The Court reiterates, however, that the expression “prescribed by law” does not merely require that the measure should have a basis in domestic law, but also refers to the quality of the law in question. The law must be sufficiently clear and foreseeable in its terms to give individuals an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are entitled to resort to the impugned measures. Domestic law must also afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the rights guaranteed by the Convention.(i)      Whether the interpretation of the term “political activity” was sufficiently clear and foreseeable(α)     Submissions by the parties91.  The applicants submitted that the Foreign Agents Act defined “political activity” as activity including any joint effort to solve social problems which was made by citizens who were united in an organisation. Although the generally accepted meaning of political activity primarily concerned the struggle for power, Russian legislation had redefined this term to include most of the activities that constituted the core of the work of any non-commercial organisation, particularly socially active organisations. Within the meaning of the Foreign Agents Act, any activity that had public resonance and was capable of influencing public opinion was considered “political”. Such a wide definition of political activity had been intentionally used by the authorities to restrict the activities of the applicant organisations and suppress the dissemination of ideas which deviated from or were critical of the official position.92.  According to the Government, the concept of “political activity” in the Foreign Agents Act had been clearly formulated from the outset, and activities in the fields of science, culture, the arts, healthcare, charity work and so on were excluded from its scope (see paragraph 15 above). The 2014 judgment of the Constitutional Court had provided clarification about the forms that political activities could take (see paragraph 38 above). In 2016 the definition had been updated to specify the forms and fields in which “political activity” might take place and the aims of such activity (see paragraph 28 above). There was no uncertainty as to the scope of the term, because generally accepted definitions of political activity could also be found in Russian dictionaries, including a 1996 dictionary for the State, politics and the State service, a 2001 dictionary of politics, and a 2006 large encyclopaedic dictionary of law. Lastly, the Government submitted, by reference to the judgment in the case of Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 48876/08, § 59, ECHR 2013 (extracts)), that the definition of “political activity” in UK law was no more detailed, clear and precise than the equivalent concept in Russian law.93.  The Commissioner submitted that the application of the Foreign Agents Act revealed a fundamental uncertainty surrounding the term “political activity” as interpreted by executive, prosecutorial and judicial branches. For example, the authorities had determined that translating and analysing judgments of the Court (in the case of the Mass Media Defence Centre in Voronezh) or disseminating the Commissioner’s opinions on the Foreign Agents Act via an association’s website (the Soldiers’ Mothers of St Petersburg) constituted “political activity”, whereas all such activities fell within the legitimate exercise of freedom of expression. The activities qualified as “political” under the Foreign Agents Act were some of the most commonly practised, basic and natural methods which civil society institutions employed to perform their work. Moreover, they constituted important elements of the democratic process.94.  The ISHR, the ICJ, Amnesty International, and the Media Legal Defence Initiative characterised the term “political activity” as being too vague, and one which violated NGOs’ right to communicate with international organisations and afforded authorities an overly broad discretion.(β)      The applicable principles95.  The Court has accepted that conduct which may entail involvement in political activities cannot be defined with absolute precision, and may include participation in peaceful assemblies, making statements to the press, participating in radio or television programmes, publications, or joining trade unions, associations or other organisations representing and protecting various group interests (see Rekvényi v. Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, § 36, ECHR 1999‑III). Admittedly, legal opinions on what aims should be considered “political” may differ, on account of this being a wide notion open to very diverse interpretations (see Zhechev v. Bulgaria, no. 57045/00, § 39, 21 June 2007). Nevertheless, a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” unless it is formulated in such a manner as to enable the citizen to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, that certain conduct would lead to specific legal consequences or sanctions (see Öztürk v. Turkey [GC], no. 22479/93, § 54, ECHR 1999‑VI).(γ)      Interpretation and application of the exceptions to the “political activities”96.  Even though certain fields of activity were explicitly excluded from the scope of “political activities” in the Foreign Agents Act, Russian authorities and courts interpreted the term “political activities” so widely that the usual activities of civil society organisations were included, in particular those in environmental, cultural or social fields. The authorities could label any activities which were in some way related to the normal functioning of a democratic society as “political”, and accordingly order the relevant organisations to register as “foreign agents” or pay fines.97.  In particular, the authorities put NGOs on the register of foreign agents for engaging in the following activities in the environmental field: organising a conference on the negative impact of hydraulic structures on rivers, protecting rivers, developing ecotourism, environmental education, and participating in public consultations on an environmental impact assessment (Baikal Wave); supporting an environmental activist (the Dront Centre); contributing to the development of environmental education and initiatives (Ecodefence); promoting the sustainable management of water resources, incentive measures for water consumers and environmental actions, and presenting the results of a sociological survey at a round-table discussion (the Ecology and Security Centre); cleaning the banks of local rivers and restoring forests (the Foundation For Nature); posting drawings on the subject of a nuclear waste dump on the Internet, and organising cycling events to promote environmental values (Green World Local); organising discussions on climate change, its impact on indigenous peoples, and the impact of mining operations on indigenous peoples’ land (the Indigenous Peoples’ Centre); being involved in a forest conservation campaign and informing the public about the state of the environment (the Movement For Nature); posting publications on environmental problems on the Internet (the Partnership for Development); promoting the use of clean energy (Planet of Hope); and implementing an initiative to support Greenpeace’s members (the Siberian Environmental Centre) (see paragraphs 210, 283, 290, 297, 311, 381, 416, 519, 533, 554, and 631 below).98.  Cultural and social activities were likewise deemed to constitute “political activity”: a round-table discussion on stopping full-day groups in nursery schools (the Centre for Social and Labour Rights); recommendations concerning a centre for sports medicine, funeral services and assistance for homeless people; the distribution of free condoms and syringes (the Chapayevsk Medical Association); supporting a petition to a governor regarding a regional disability programme, and participating in a conference on social entrepreneurship (the Far East Centre); criticising a proposal to abolish a benefit paid to people with multiple children, and a prohibition on using drinking water to water gardens (Gagarin Park); the protection of cultural items and areas, preparing expert opinions on this subject, and collecting information on threats to items of cultural heritage (Green World and the Perm Human Rights Centre); monitoring social and economic developments and organising discussions on housing and social issues (the Levada Centre); issuing a publication on the right to spa-based therapy in Perm (the Perm Human Rights Centre); organising forums on pressing social issues (Perm-36); and training medical doctors on the prevention of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases in the homosexual community (Rakurs) (see paragraphs 222, 236, 304, 339, 374 451, 540, 547 and 575 below).99.  Other applicant organisations, including the Centre for Social and Labour Rights, the Centre for Social Studies, Coming Out, the Human Rights Academy, Migration XXI Century, and the Women of the Don, were deemed not to have complied with the Foreign Agents Act in relation to activities in the field of the protection of human rights, because they had stood up for labour rights, LGBT and women’s rights, and the rights of migrants. In other cases, commemorative events were considered to be “political activities”, as in the cases of the Mass Media Defence Centre and the Southern Human Rights Centre (see paragraphs 473 and 653 below).100.  The above examples demonstrate that the exclusions from the scope of the concept of “political activities” – such as culture, social security, the protection of flora and fauna, and charity work – established in the Foreign Agents Act (see paragraph 28 above) have been rendered meaningless by the unforeseeable practice of the Act which has been endorsed by the Russian courts. For example, Baikal Wave, an environmental organisation active in the protection of flora and fauna, which is not considered to be political activity, was deemed to have engaged in “political activities” once it had expressed an opinion on the decisions of State authorities on the protection of plants or another environmental matter, because “expressing opinions on decisions of State authorities” does constitute “political” activity (see paragraph 215 below).(δ)      Distinguishing between the activities of an organisation and its staff101.  The Constitutional Court required authorities to draw a distinction between the activities of members and directors of organisations which were undertaken in a personal capacity, and those which were carried out on behalf of an organisation. Only the latter activities, but not the former, could fall within the scope of “political activities” under the Foreign Agents Act (see paragraph 39 above). In practice, however, any statements or positions by the directors of the applicant organisations were routinely attributed to the organisations themselves, without establishing whether they had been made in a personal capacity or on behalf of the organisation. In the cases of the Civil Education Centre, the Dront Centre, Legal Mission, the Mass Media Defence Centre, the Movement For Human Rights, Planet of Hope, the Renaissance Centre, the School of the Conscript, the Sova Centre and the Women of the Don, the authorities considered the statements which the organisations’ directors had made in discussions, interviews or on websites, and their participation in projects, one of the aspects of the applicant organisations’ “political activity” (see paragraphs 257, 283, 444, 472, 512, 554, 596, 624, 659 and 689 below). In the cases of Baikal Wave and the Perm Human Rights Centre, the director’s comments on a journalist’s personal blog, a request to ban agricultural burning which had been submitted to the State authorities, and the founder’s personal blog were taken to constitute “political activity” on the part of the organisations themselves (see paragraphs 210 and 540 below). In the case of Ryazan Memorial, the authorities considered photos posted by the applicant organisation’s director on his personal page on a social network “political activity” (see paragraph 603 below). It follows that, in the absence of any clear and foreseeable legal regulation, the applicant organisations had to countenance a risk that any statements by their directors, members or founders, even comments on their private accounts on social media, could be qualified as “political activity” on the part of the organisations themselves.102.  In other cases, the authorities linked the work of the applicant organisations’ directors in State bodies – bodies to which they had been appointed in a personal or professional capacity, rather than as representatives of their respective organisations – to the activities of the organisations themselves. In the cases of the Agora Association, the Chapayevsk Medical Association, the Civil Education Centre, the Committee against Torture and the Mass Media Defence Centre, their directors’ or founders’ work in the President’s Human Rights Council and regional bodies of government was considered by the authorities to be “political activity” on the part of the applicant organisations themselves (see paragraphs 208, 236, 257, 270 and 472 below).(ε)      Interpretations of the forms of “political activities”103.  The Constitutional Court also outlined the forms in which the intention to engage in political activities could manifest itself, and the evidence which made such an intention apparent. It also emphasised that the ultimate purpose of political activities was to influence the decision-making process of State organs and State policy (see paragraph 39 above). In practice, however, the authorities dispensed with the requirement to show that the opinions expressed had potentially had an impact on their decisions. In the case of Sakhalin Environment Watch, the authorities considered the signing of a letter addressed to the Ukrainian environmental organisations and activists and published on the website of the Wildlife Conservation Centre during the Russian-Ukrainian conflict in 2014 “political activity”. The letter was not addressed to the authorities of any State, its addressees were exclusively environmental organisations and activists of Ukraine, and it did not contain any requests or demands addressed to the authorities (see paragraph 610 and 612 below). Nevertheless, the Russian courts considered the letter of solidarity to be “political activity” on the part of the applicant organisation. In the case of the Levada Centre, the domestic courts held that the opinions on the political regime in Russia expressed by the applicant organisation’s director and the head of a department in a lecture, in interviews and in articles published on a website, evidenced that the Levada Centre had exercised “political activity”; the courts made that finding without analysing whether those opinions had encouraged a change in the authorities’ policy (see paragraph 453 below).(στ)   Conclusion104.  Bearing in mind that the term “political” is inherently vague and could be subject to diverse interpretations, the need for its stable, consistent and foreseeable interpretation was all the greater in these cases. Dictionaries, to which the Government referred, may be used to establish the ordinary meaning of words but they are not a substitute for legislative precision and well-established case-law. The Russian authorities applied an extensive and unforeseeable interpretation to the term “political activities” which was used in the Foreign Agents Act, to include even activities which were specifically listed as being excluded from its scope, and they treated indiscriminately the activities of organisations themselves, those of their directors or members who were acting in a personal capacity, and those that lacked the requisite finality to influence State decisions and policy. Whereas the Foreign Agents Act required the purpose of influencing State policy in order to qualify as political activity (see paragraph 28 above), the practice of executive and other authorities extended the concept of “political activity” to any form of public advocacy on an extremely wide set of issues, without establishing whether the organisation had pursued its activities with the aim of influencing State policy. The classification of NGOs’ activities based on this criterion – whether they constituted “political activities” – produced incoherent results and engendered uncertainty among NGOs wishing to engage in civil society activities relating to, in particular, human rights or the protection of the environment or charity work, especially since the domestic courts failed to provide consistent guidance as to what actions did or did not constitute “political activity” (see Zhechev, cited above, § 55, and The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others v. Bulgaria (no. 2), no. 34960/04, § 39, 18 October 2011).(ii)    Whether the provisions on “foreign funding” are sufficiently foreseeable(α)     Submissions by the parties105.  The applicants pointed out that the provisions on foreign financing contained in the Foreign Agents Act were not foreseeable and did not establish any particular amount, period or form of foreign funding required for an organisation to be declared a “foreign agent”. The Russian authorities had adopted an excessively broad and unpredictable interpretation of the term “foreign funding”. As the practical application of the Foreign Agents Act demonstrated, not only was the receipt of funds or other property by NGOs considered foreign financing, but also cash payments to their employees or members, and joint activities with other “foreign-agent” organisations. Even a refusal to accept foreign funding did not guarantee that an organisation that had refused such funding would not be branded a “foreign agent”. In addition, the recipients of funds did not have the opportunity to check the exact source of funding, since information about a donor’s citizenship or a donor organisation’s source of funds was not publicly available, and Russian legislation did not impose an obligation on organisations to verify the origin of funds transferred from another Russian organisation.106.  The Government submitted that the term “foreign funding” was clearly defined in the Act and had additionally been clarified by the Constitutional Court. The specific parameters of such funding – whether temporal (relating to the duration or frequency of the funding), quantitative (relating to the amount or extent of the funding) or material (relating to whether the funding constituted a donation, grant or award) – did not matter, so long as the funds came from a foreign source. The law applied to funds and to any other property; the form in which funding was received – for example, a credit to a bank account or payment for events, services or other expenses – had no legal significance. Such funds and property must have been received after the date of enactment of the Foreign Agents Act. The law did not require the authorities to show that an organisation was aware of the foreign origin of funds it had accepted. Organisations engaging in “political activities” were to bear the risk of their ignorance as to the origin of their financing. If the authorities were required to prove that a recipient was aware of the foreign origin of funds, this would render the enforcement of the provisions on indirect foreign financing difficult.(β)      Purpose of disbursements107.  The Court notes that the Foreign Agents Act does not contain any rules as to the purpose of “foreign funding” and does not require the authorities to establish any link between such funding and the alleged “political activities” of the organisation. The absence of any rules relating to the purpose of disbursements has led to absurd situations, such as the case of the Civil Education Centre, in which the Russian authorities and courts concluded that the organisation was “financed” by a “foreign source” because a hotel in Oslo had refunded it for paying too much to hire conference facilities and rooms (see paragraph 259 below).(γ)      Distinguishing between the funds received by the organisation and those received by its staff108.  The term “foreign funding” has also been used indiscriminately by the authorities to include any disbursements – not just those paid to the applicant organisations, but also those paid to its members or directors, even where they acted in a personal capacity without involving an organisation. For example, the Southern Human Rights Centre was recognised as a “foreign agent”, in particular on the grounds that the head of the applicant organisation had received funds to purchase return airline tickets from Sochi to Moscow to visit the Goethe-Institut German cultural centre, where he had taken part in an event in his personal capacity rather than as the head of the applicant organisation (see paragraphs 652 and 654 below).(δ)      Interpretation of “foreign sources”109.  The Foreign Agents Act defines the term “foreign source” as one including both proper foreign sources, such as foreign States, institutions, associations and individuals, and any Russian entities “receiving funds and other property from those sources” (see paragraph 15 above). Such a Russian entity need not be designated as a “foreign agent” or otherwise identified as a “foreign source” at the moment when funds are made available. The law does not specify any criteria in accordance with which a Russian entity may be deemed to fall into this category, such as a threshold amount or a percentage of an annual budget or the use of designated foreign funds for sub‑granting to national organisations. This creates a situation of uncertainty, where a token donation from abroad may lead the authorities to classify a Russian entity as a foreign source of funds, and any organisations which have received funds from that entity as “foreign agents”. For example, Yekaterinburg Memorial had not received any financing from proper foreign sources. However, as another applicant organisation, International Memorial, had paid its insurance, utilities, electricity and telephone bills over a two-year period, the authorities considered that to be sufficient evidence of “foreign financing”, because International Memorial had been designated as a “foreign agent” (see paragraph 696 below). Gagarin Park was put on the register of foreign agents because it had received funds from a Russian charity foundation which, it subsequently transpired, had been financed from abroad (see paragraph 339 below). In the case of the School of the Conscript, the fact that another “foreign-agent” applicant organisation, Legal Mission, had paid for its website and office was considered evidence of “foreign funding” (see paragraph 624 below).110.  The absence of clear and foreseeable criteria has given the authorities unfettered discretion to assert that the applicant organisations were in receipt of “foreign funding”, no matter how remote or tenuous their association with a purported “foreign source” was. The cases of the Golos Association and Tak-Tak-Tak provide an illustration of this. In both cases, the directors of the applicant organisations had also sat on the boards of some other organisations which had been branded “foreign agents”. The fact that those other organisations had received foreign financing was, for the Russian authorities, sufficient to link “foreign sources” to the applicant organisations via their directors (see paragraphs 355 and 666 below). The Court considers that the applicant organisations could not reasonably foresee that such implausible and arbitrary connections would be established and that the money they received would be considered tainted by its foreign origin no matter how many degrees of separation there were between the recipient organisation and the purported “foreign source”.(ε)      Existence of a legal possibility to decline foreign funding111.  Lastly, the Court finds that the circumstances in which a refusal of foreign funding could be considered valid were neither clear nor foreseeable. In the case of the Golos Association, the first-instance court found that, by refusing prize money from Norway, the Golos Association had validly refused foreign funding, which made the Foreign Agents Act inapplicable. However, shortly thereafter, during appeal proceedings, the same court found that the refusal of the same prize money had constituted the receipt of foreign funding, since by refusing to receive those funds, the Golos Association had taken a decision on its fate and demonstrated “the authority of an owner” in respect of that amount (see paragraph 355 below). It was not until an extraordinary procedure was set in motion upon an application by the Ombudsman that that judgment was reviewed. Another example is that of Sakhalin Environment Watch, which refused foreign funding immediately after its inclusion on the register of foreign agents and asked to be removed from the register. However, the authorities refused to remove it from the register of foreign agents on the grounds that it was required to return all the funding it had received from foreign donors during the entire period of its activity, and not just from the date of its inclusion on the register of foreign agents (see paragraph 612 below).(στ)   Conclusion112.  As demonstrated by the above examples, the applicants were unable to envisage with a sufficient degree of foreseeability what funding and what sources of funding would qualify as “foreign funding” for the purposes of registration as a “foreign agent”. The legal norm on foreign funding which allows for its overbroad and unpredictable interpretation in practice, as evident from the circumstances of the present cases, does not meet the “quality of law” requirement and deprives the applicants of the possibility to regulate their financial situation.(iii)   Whether the term “foreign agent” is sufficiently clear and foreseeable(α)     Submissions by the parties113.  The applicants submitted that the term “foreign agent” was intentionally used in the Foreign Agents Act with the aim of creating the impression among the public that Russian NGOs were acting in Russia on the orders of and in the interests of “foreign” States or organisations. According to its generally accepted meaning, the term “agent” referred to a person performing assignments on behalf of another. According to the definition in the Russian Civil Code, one party to the agency agreement (the agent) undertook to perform legal and other actions on the instructions of the other party (the principal) for remuneration. However, the term was given a wide and novel interpretation in the Foreign Agents Act and in the practical application of that Act, by the scope of the term being extended to include any Russian organisation engaging in political activity, not necessarily in the interests of a foreign provider of funds. The concept of a “foreign agent” used in the US FARA Act (the United States being the only other jurisdiction in which such a term existed), which the Government asserted was a relevant comparator for Russia’s Foreign Agents Act, was fundamentally different. The FARA Act associated the status of a “foreign agent” with the exercise of activities “on the order, request or instructions or under the supervision” of a foreign principal, and “in the interests” of such a principal. Both of those conditions were necessary for an entity to be registered as a “foreign agent”.114.  The Government submitted that the term “foreign agent” was sufficiently clear and its application in practice foreseeable, firstly because it was defined in the Foreign Agents Act, and secondly because it was in itself a well-established legal category. In the realm of civil law, an “agent” was an entity authorised to act on behalf of another or execute official and business orders of another. It was logical to apply that term to Russian NGOs receiving funding from foreign sources to implement certain activities. The Government considered that the definition of an “agent of a foreign principal” in the US FARA Act, which encompassed any person engaging in political activities and public relations or collecting and dispensing contributions, was essentially similar to that of a “foreign agent” in Russian law.115.  The ILPP pointed out that the US FARA Act required evidence of a principal-agent relationship between the “foreign agent” and its “foreign principal” implying a high level of dependence and control between the domestic association and its foreign donor. By contrast, for a Russian NGO participating in “political activity”, receiving funding from abroad was sufficient for the NGO to be considered a “foreign agent”. It was not necessary to prove that it was acting “in the interests” of any foreign entity.116.  The Hungarian NGOs and the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights submitted that the Russian Government’s analogy with the US FARA Act was deeply flawed, as the FARA Act was targeted not at civil society, but at professional lobbyists, that is, political players acting on behalf of governments, which was the opposite of what NGOs did.(β)      The Court’s approach117.  The Court considers that, whatever a generally accepted meaning or a legal definition of a particular term, the legislator is entitled to adopt a different meaning for the purposes of a particular legal act as long as it is formulated with sufficient precision and remains sufficiently clear and foreseeable in its application. The definition of a “foreign agent” used in the Foreign Agents Act has introduced a different concept of agency in which an agent might or might not be acting in the interests of the principal, as it apparent from the text of the document (see paragraph 15 above: “including ... activity carried out in the interests of foreign providers of funds”). This definition encompasses all situations in which a Russian NGO received “foreign funding” and engaged in “political activities”, including where the funding does not translate into donor’s control and direction, and is apparently based on an assumption that “foreign funding” – irrespective of the amount or the modalities and conditions of its granting – equals foreign control. Such definition of an agency relationship may indeed be a wide and novel one, however, there is no uncertainty in the fact that any Russian NGOs receiving any amount of “foreign” funding may come within the scope of this legislation. Consequently, the Court finds that no issue of clarity or foreseeability of that definition arises and that this matter must be examined below from the standpoint of the necessity requirement.(iv)  Conclusion on the lawfulness requirement118.  The Court has found above that two key concepts of the Foreign Agents Act, as formulated and interpreted in practice by the Russian authorities, fell short of the foreseeability requirement. The facts of the present cases demonstrate that judicial review failed to provide adequate and effective safeguards against the arbitrary and discriminatory exercise of the wide discretion left to the executive (compare Lashmankin and Others v. Russia, nos. 57818/09 and 14 others, § 430, 7 February 2017). This would be sufficient for a finding of a violation of Article 11, interpreted in the light of Article 10, on the basis that the interference was not prescribed by law. The Court notes, nevertheless, that the questions in this case are closely related to the broader issue of whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society”. In particular, the Court must verify whether the restrictions on the applicants’ activities corresponded in principle to a “pressing social need”, and whether they were proportionate to the aims sought to be achieved (see Koretskyy and Others v. Ukraine, no. 40269/02, § 49, 3 April 2008, and Tebieti Mühafize Cemiyyeti and Israfilov, cited above, § 65).(c)   Legitimate aim119.  The applicants conceded that the interference had pursued the valid objective of exercising control by society and the authorities over the spending of funds received from foreign sources.120.  The Government submitted that the interference had aimed to ensure public control, security and greater transparency in respect of the political activities of foreign-funded NGOs.121.  The third-party interveners, including the ILPP, the Special Rapporteur, the Hungarian NGOs, the ICJ and Amnesty International, submitted that the protection of sovereignty and security could not be relied upon as a lawful ground for imposing restrictions on civil society organisations.122.  The Court accepts in principle that the objective of increasing the transparency with regard to the funding of civil society organisations may correspond to the legitimate aim of the protection of public order in paragraph 2 of Article 11.(d)   “Necessary in a democratic society”(i)      General principles123.  The Court reiterates that citizens’ ability to form a legal entity in order to act collectively in a field of mutual interest is one of the most important aspects of the right to freedom of association, without which that right would be deprived of any meaning. The way in which national legislation enshrines this freedom and its practical application by the authorities reveal the state of democracy in the country concerned. Certainly States have a right to satisfy themselves that an association’s aim and activities are in conformity with the rules laid down in legislation, but the State’s power to protect its institutions and citizens from associations that might jeopardise them must be used sparingly, as exceptions to the rule of freedom of association are to be construed strictly and only convincing and compelling reasons can justify restrictions on that freedom. Any interference must correspond to a “pressing social need”; thus, the notion “necessary” does not have the flexibility of such expressions as “useful” or “desirable” (see Sidiropoulos and Others v. Greece, 10 July 1998, § 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998‑IV, and Gorzelik and Others, cited above, §§ 88 and 94-95).124.  The Court has acknowledged that the function of creating various platforms for public debate is not limited to the press, but may also be exercised by, among others, NGOs, whose activities are an essential element of informed public debate. The Court has accepted that when an NGO draws attention to matters of public interest, it is exercising a public watchdog role of similar importance to that of the press and may be characterised as a social “watchdog” warranting similar protection under the Convention as that afforded to the press. It has recognised that civil society makes an important contribution to the discussion of public affairs. The manner in which “public watchdogs” carry out their activities may have a significant impact on the proper functioning of a democratic society. It is in the interest of democratic society to enable the press to exercise its vital role of “public watchdog” in imparting information on matters of public concern, just as it is to enable NGOs scrutinising the State to do the same thing (see Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v. Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, §§ 166-67, 8 November 2016, with further references).125.  It is further relevant to recall that there is a wealth of historical, cultural and political differences within Europe so that it is for each State to mould its own democratic vision. By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, their societies and their needs, the legislative and judicial authorities are best placed to assess the particular difficulties in safeguarding the democratic order in their State. The State must therefore be accorded some discretion as regards this country-specific and complex assessment which is of central relevance to the legislative choices such as are at issue in the present case (see Animal Defenders International, cited above, § 111).(ii)    Whether creating a special status of “foreign agents” was necessary in a democratic society(α)     Submissions by the parties126.  The applicants submitted that the term “agent” itself, even without the adjective “foreign”, had an unambiguously negative connotation in the Russian context. Since the time of Stalin’s regime, the word “agent”, used idiomatically, had been endowed with a markedly negative meaning placing it in the same semantic category as the words “saboteur”, “spy” and “traitor”. The fact that the Russian authorities were fully aware of such negative connotations was apparent from their strong objection to having their representative at the Court referred to as the “Agent of the Russian Government”. The Court had accepted that, by contrast with representatives of other member States who were referred to as Agents, that term would not be used to describe the representative of the Russian Government. A large‑scale survey of the Russian population carried out in December 2016 found that 60% of the respondents had negative associations with the term “foreign agent”, 30% of the population reported having neutral associations, and only 3% reported positive associations. The State authorities themselves directly linked “political activity” within the meaning of the Foreign Agents Act with anti-State actions and the undermining of the constitutional system. The label “foreign agent” was so shameful and offensive that some of the applicant organisations, in order to avoid public humiliation, had refused foreign funding and had consequently been forced to terminate their programmes and cease all or some of their activities, which was a typical manifestation of the “chilling effect”.127.  The Government insisted that the term “foreign agent” did not have any negative undertones. They referred to the 2014 judgment of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, according to which the designation of Russian NGOs as exercising the functions of a “foreign agent” was conditional on the receipt of funds and other property from foreign sources, and intended to identify them as “specific subjects of political activities carried out in the Russian territory”. It did not suggest that those organisations posed a threat to the State or public institutions “even if they acted on the orders of or on behalf of foreign funders”. “Attempts to establish the negative context” of the term “foreign agent” were a Soviet-era stereotype which was no longer meaningful in today’s realities. The designation did not imply any negative assessment of any such organisation by the State and could not be interpreted as a manifestation of a lack of trust or a desire to discredit those organisations, or their aims or activities. The Government emphasised that the registration of the applicant organisations as “non‑commercial organisations exercising the functions of a foreign agent” had in no way affected their ability to freely express their ideas and engage in political activities, including their ability to take part in debates. The Government attached decisive importance to the fact that the Foreign Agents Act did not provide for the liquidation of organisations for failure to apply for registration as a “foreign agent”.128.  The Commissioner observed that the term “foreign agent” carried with it strong negative connotations, since it had usually been associated in the Russian historical context with the notion of a “foreign spy” or a “traitor”. Legislative amendments had restricted “foreign-agent” organisations’ opportunity to interact with State officials and perform certain types of public activities. The use of the label “foreign agent” had not only affected the ability of non-commercial organisations to cooperate with State institutions, but also their relations with other partners and the general public. “Foreign-agent” non-commercial organisations had also been the targets of a smear campaign in the media: the environmental organisation Planet of Hope had been charged with “industrial espionage funded by US money” and its director had had to flee Russia.129.  The ICJ, Amnesty International, and the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights emphasised the stigmatising effect of labelling NGOs “foreign agents”. Such measures interfered with the right to freedom of association under Article 11 of the Convention. As they also affected the capacity of NGOs and their representatives to engage in public debate, they similarly interfered with the right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention.130.  The Hungarian NGOs submitted that the stigmatisation of NGOs served to discredit those who raised their voices against the detrimental activities of the authorities. Criticising the authorities was likened to criticising the nation itself.(β)      Choice of an allegedly stigmatising term131.  The parties disagreed on the sentiment evoked by the expression “foreign agent”. For the applicants, third-party interveners and independent experts, including the Commissioner and the Venice Commission, it conveyed “a connotation of ostracism or stigma” across large sections of the Russian population, and could therefore be a threat to the free exercise of the activities of non-commercial organisations which had been labelled in that way (see paragraphs 50 and 51 above). The Venice Commission emphasised that, even without the specific Russian historical context, the term “foreign agent” always carried a negative connotation so long as it suggested that an organisation was acting “on behalf and in the interests of the foreign source”, rather than in the interests of Russian society (paragraph 55 of the Opinion). The Government claimed, by reference to the judgment of the Constitutional Court, that the term “foreign agent” had lost the negative connotation it had had in the past. The Court notes that the Government did not corroborate their assertion with any evidence, while the findings of a major opinion poll of the Russian population appear to suggest otherwise (see paragraph 126 above). Nor did the Government give any explanation or at least indication as to why the term “foreign agent” had been chosen, what alternatives had been considered, and whether the term’s connotations had been taken into account.132.  The Court has previously found that, even where measures taken by the authorities have not actually restricted the right of an association to carry out its activities, the use of stigmatising language to describe that association may have had adverse consequences for its operation. The use of hostile terms constitutes interference with an association’s rights, and needs to be justified as being necessary in a democratic society (see Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others, cited above, §§ 84-101, and compare Aliyev v. Azerbaijan, nos. 68762/14 and 71200/14, § 210, 20 September 2018). The Court also notes the view of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) that the designation of civil society organisations as “organisations in receipt of support from abroad” is capable of creating a generalised climate of mistrust towards those organisations and stigmatising them (see paragraph 47 above).133.  The parties appear to concur that the term “agent”, in its generally accepted meaning, designates a person or an entity which carries out certain work or tasks on the orders or instructions of another individual or entity (the “principal”) in return for remuneration in the framework of the principal-agent relationship. The term “agent” has consistently been used in that sense in Russian civil law, federal legislation and by-laws, and also in many other jurisdictions. Adding the adjective “foreign” implies that the principal is a foreign entity on behalf of which the agent is acting.134.  As the Court noted in paragraph 117 above, the definition of a “foreign agent” in the Foreign Agents Act introduced a concept of agency in which the control of the donor over the recipient of funds was effectively presumed rather than established on a case-by-case basis, even in a situation where the recipient of funds retained full managerial and operational independence in terms of defining its programmes, policies and priorities. This presumption was moreover unrebuttable because any evidence of operational independence of the grantee from the donor was legally irrelevant for designation of the targeted organisation as a “foreign agent”, the mere fact of receiving any amount of money from “foreign sources” sufficed.135.  The administrative and judicial practice in the applicants’ cases confirmed that interpretation of the agency relationship: neither the Ministry of Justice nor the courts considered it necessary to show that the applicant organisations had been acting in the interests of foreign sources, and deemed the fact that they had received foreign funding and had been carrying out political activities sufficient evidence of their being “foreign agents”. It has not been claimed or established in any of the applicants’ cases that they had acted on behalf of, on the orders of, or in the interests of a foreign entity, or that they had been anything but independent actors in their respective fields of activity. For example, in the case of the Southern Human Rights Centre, the organisation received funds from another Russian NGO which had already been included on the register of foreign agents, for the purpose of creating its own website (see paragraph 652 below). Another applicant, Woman’s World, received a donation from a Russian NGO to hold an awareness-raising event on the prevention of domestic violence, and yet another, Tak-Tak-Tak, used funds from the French Embassy in Moscow to hold a seminar on the security of human rights defenders (see paragraphs 666 and 680 below). In taking the decisions to register those organisations as “foreign agents”, neither the Ministry of Justice nor the courts concerned themselves with showing that they had acted as “agents” in the interests of the organisations indicated as being the sources of their foreign funding.136.  The Court considers therefore that attaching the label of a “foreign agent” to any applicant organisations which have received any funds from foreign entities was unjustified and prejudicial and also liable to have a strong deterrent and stigmatising effect on their operations. That label coloured them as being under foreign control in disregard of the fact that they saw themselves as members of national civil society working to uphold respect for human rights, the rule of law, and human development for the benefit of Russian society and democratic system.(γ)      Creation of a new category of “foreign-agent” NGOs137.  The choice of a term for labelling a new category of Russian non‑commercial organisations is part of a broader question of whether the creation of such a status can be justified as being “necessary in a democratic society”.138.  The Court reiterates that a State can, consistently with the Convention, adopt general measures which apply to pre-defined situations regardless of the individual facts of each case even if this might result in individual hard cases. In order to determine the proportionality of a general measure, the Court must primarily assess the legislative choices underlying it and the quality of the parliamentary and judicial review of the necessity of the measure, attaching particular importance to the operation of the margin of appreciation (see Animal Defenders International, cited above, §§ 106‑10).139.  The democratic process is an ongoing one which needs to be continuously supported by free and pluralistic public debate and carried forward by many actors of civil society, including individual activists and NGOs (ibid., § 111). Where risks to that process have been identified, foreign involvement in some sensitive areas – such as elections or funding of political movements – may justify stricter regulation or restrictions by the State, as ensuring the transparency of NGOs receiving substantial foreign funding is a legitimate aim. Nevertheless, as the Court has found above, the scope of the Foreign Agents Act and, in particular, the definition of “political activities” goes much further than what is customarily regarded as matters of national security or sensitive State interests. In essence, the regulation appears to be based on a notion that matters such as respect for human rights and the rule of law are “internal affairs” of the State and that any external scrutiny of such matters is suspect and a potential threat to national interests. This notion is not compatible with the drafting history and underlying values of the Convention as an instrument of European public order and collective security: that the rights of all persons within the legal space of the Convention are a matter of concern to all member States of the Council of Europe.140.  The Court recalls, in this respect, that even before the Foreign Agents Act, the legislation on non-commercial organisations contained mechanisms allowing the State and society to exercise scrutiny over the receipt and spending of funds by non-commercial organisations, including funds from foreign sources. The Government did not identify any shortcomings or risks of abuse in the previously existing legal framework which the creation of a new status of “foreign agents” sought to address which prevents the Court from assessing the rationale for the new regulation. Instead, it appears that the “foreign-agent” status was put in place to set the applicant organisations apart from other non-commercial organisations and to subject them and their activities to a much stricter State scrutiny.141.  Once an organisation was assigned “foreign-agent” status, it was confronted with not only additional accounting and reporting requirements which the Court will address below but also a number of adverse consequences which went beyond merely legal consequences. The Commissioner and the Venice Commission observed that a non-commercial organisation labelled as a “foreign agent” would “most probably encounter an atmosphere of mistrust, fear and hostility making it difficult for it to operate”. They cited an example of homeless people refusing the offer of shelter from representatives of a humanitarian NGO because they did not want help from “foreign agents” (paragraph 54 of the Opinion).142.  The Court is particularly concerned with the fact that “foreign-agent” status has severely curtailed the applicant organisations’ ability to interact with the representatives of State authorities, including those with whom they had worked together for many years prior to their registration as “foreign agents”. The Commissioner and the Venice Commission noted that the representatives of State institutions would likely be reluctant to cooperate with “foreign-agent” organisations, in particular in discussions on possible changes to legislation or public policy (paragraph 55 of the Opinion). Such a risk did, in fact, materialise. For example, in the case of Yekaterinburg Memorial, the Ministry for General and Professional Education in the Sverdlovsk Region sent a circular letter, no. 02-01-82/1861 of 10 March 2017, requiring the heads of secondary and higher-education institutions in the region “to take measures to restrict the participation of educators and students” in events organised by that “foreign-agent” organisation. The Civil Education Centre received letters from four State and municipal educational institutions stating that those institutions no longer wished to collaborate with the applicant organisation following its registration as a “foreign agent”. Following its inclusion on the register of “foreign agents”, Sakhalin Environment Watch received a similar letter from the Sakhalin Regional Border Guard Department, with which it had previously successfully collaborated in preventing poaching.143.  The executive authorities sought to distance themselves from “foreign-agent” organisations and sever any links to their directors or members. In the case of Woman’s World, a decree of the governor of the Kaliningrad Region, no. 196 of 30 December 2015, prohibited members of “foreign-agent” organisations from being members of the Governor’s Socio‑Political Council, and the director of the applicant organisation was expelled from that council. On 14 September 2015 a lawyer with the Perm Human Rights Centre was prevented from participating in a meeting of a judicial qualifications board due to his links with the “foreign-agent” organisation. He was eventually able to continue his work, but not before adopting a different affiliation.144.  Restrictions on the participation of “foreign-agent” organisations in the political and social life of Russian society gradually found their way into federal legislation. A series of amendments to the electoral laws denied such organisations any form of involvement in any kind of election (see paragraph 30 above). The applicant organisations which stand up for fair elections and act as “election watchdogs” – the Golos Association and the Golos Fund, among others –were denied the opportunity to continue their missions as independent election monitors. The amended legislation likened the position of Russian “foreign-agent” organisations to that of foreign or international observers. The legislation established a procedure for extending an invitation to foreign or international observers but failed to define an equivalent procedure for inviting national organisations, which effectively thwarted any monitoring efforts by Russian organisations once they had been listed as “foreign agents”.145.  In more recent developments, restrictions on the activities of “foreign-agent” organisations were extended far outside the realm of politics to undercut their mission as independent monitors of State actors in other areas. The 2018 amendments withdrew the right of “foreign-agent” organisations to nominate candidates to public monitoring bodies, which were the only civil society institutions with access to penal facilities and the authority to highlight issues concerning human rights compliance in places of detention (see paragraph 34 above, and Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, §§ 105-106, 10 January 2012). Another law deprived “foreign-agent” organisations of the opportunity to expose the potential for graft and corruption which proposed draft legislation might offer State officials (see paragraph 35 above).(δ)      Conclusion146.  It follows that the creation of the new status severely restricted the ability of the applicant organisations to continue their activities, because of the negative attitude of their target groups and because of the regulatory and legislative restrictions on involving “foreign-agent” organisations in cooperation and monitoring projects. Their registration as “foreign agents” restricted their ability to participate in public life and engage in activities which they had been carrying out prior to the creation of the new category of “foreign agents”. The Government have not been able to adduce “relevant and sufficient” reasons for creating that new category, or show that those measures furthered the declared goal of increasing transparency. The creation of that status as defined in domestic law was therefore not “necessary in a democratic society”.(iii)   Whether the additional auditing and reporting requirements were necessary in a democratic society(α)     Submissions by the parties147.  The applicants submitted that the additional control and reporting requirements which were applicable to them on account of their status as “foreign-agent” organisations amounted a serious burden and drain on their time and resources. In the context of a shortage of resources, the main activities of “foreign-agent” organisations tended to focus on providing the authorities with a variety of additional reports and preparing for inspections, meanwhile statutory activities had to be significantly scaled down. Their staff were expected to produce four times as many reports as other non‑commercial organisations, and also pay substantial amounts for the mandatory annual audit – between RUB 50,000 and RUB 250,000 (EUR 1,250 and 8,250 at the material time). Those fixed costs were not related to the amount of foreign funding received or an organisation’s overall budget, and represented a disproportionate burden, especially for organisations with the least resources. There was also a constant risk of administrative prosecution, even for insignificant delays or superficial inaccuracies in the reports.148.  The Government submitted that the mandatory auditing requirements extended to not just “foreign-agent” organisations, but also State-owned companies and corporations and local branches of foreign NGOs. The financial reporting requirements were comparable to those existing in other jurisdictions (they referred in particular to the EU Transparency Register and the Fundamental Principles). They did not impose an excessive burden on NGOs, and allowed the domestic authorities to ensure the transparency of their funding and receive up-to-date reports about their activities. The reporting requirements also sought to increase the protection of national security and “raise public awareness” about the fact that foreign individuals and entities were involved in providing support to organisations which were engaged in political activities and exercised influence over Russian politics and foundations of the State. Lastly, the Government cited examples of domestic decisions in which the courts had discontinued administrative-offence proceedings instituted in respect of a charge of failure to submit the required reports.149.  The ILPP submitted that the Foreign Agents Act had put additional financial and administrative burdens on those NGOs which received foreign funding. It was estimated that annually, “foreign-agent” NGOs were forced to spend an average amount of RUB 273,000 more than other NGOs. By way of comparison, disclosure and reporting requirements for lobbyists controlled by foreign principals, provided for by the US FARA Act, were fundamentally different, in that they focused on lobbying, consulting and public-relations services rather than civil society organisations, whereas Russia’s Foreign Agents Act did focus on such organisations.150.  The Special Rapporteur stated that registration authorities should be independent from the Government; that reporting obligations should be simple, uniform and predictable; that the organs in charge of registration and supervision should carry out inspections only during ordinary business hours, with adequate advance notice; and that powers should not be used arbitrarily and for the harassment or intimidation of organisations.151.  The ISHR submitted that so long as “foreign-agent” organisations had to comply with cumbersome and more frequent reporting requirements, the practical consequences of being a “foreign agent” could be described as “debilitating”. The ICJ and Amnesty International emphasised that measures restricting or imposing administrative burdens on NGOs had to be the least intrusive possible, with due regard to the significance of the interests at stake. The Hungarian NGOs stated that measures prescribed by the Foreign Agents Act were disproportionate to the declared aim of transparency, and the obligation to register and report on activities was not in line with the aim pursued, nor were extraordinary inspections.(β)      The Court’s assessment152.  The Court reiterates that States may establish in their legislation rules and requirements on corporate governance and management bodies, and ensure the compliance of legal entities with such rules and requirements. In fact, the domestic laws of many member States of the Council of Europe provide for such rules and requirements, with varying degrees of regulation (see Tebieti Mühafize Cemiyyeti and Israfilov, cited above, § 72). However, in so far as legislative amendments impose new requirements on previously existing organisations, they need to be justified as being, in particular, “necessary in a democratic society” (see Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army, cited above, §§ 73-77 et passim).153.  From 2006 onwards all Russian non-commercial organisations were required to produce an annual report on their activities and sources of funding, including information on the use of funds, and submit that report to the Ministry of Justice in a pre-determined format, indicating their foreign funding sources in a special section of the report form. The report also needed to be made freely available to the public online, both on the website of the Ministry of Justice and the organisation’s own website. Therefore, even prior to the adoption of the Foreign Agents Act, the activities of non‑commercial organisations, their financial situation and their sources of funding were public and transparent, and were also under the full control of the State authorities. The Government did not claim that that legal framework had been lacking or deficient in any respect.154.  The Foreign Agents Act did not alter or extend the scope of information which “foreign-agent” non-commercial organisations ought to provide to the authorities or make public. However, it significantly increased the frequency of reporting, requiring up to four reports per year, where previously one had sufficed. Since their registration as “foreign-agent” organisations, the applicant organisations have been required to submit reports on their activities and the composition of their management boards, twice a year; reports on how foreign-source funds have been spent or property used, four times a year; and a certified audit report, once a year. The reports need to be uploaded to their websites and the Ministry of Justice’s website twice as often as before. Compliance with those requirements has been enforced by the Ministry of Justice, and failure to comply has been sanctioned with fines which are many times higher than those applicable to non-compliance by non-commercial organisations which have not been included on the register of “foreign agents”. Those organisations may be fined between RUB 3,000 and 5,000 for a failure to provide the required information to State or municipal authorities (Article 19.7 of the CAO), whereas “foreign-agent” organisations will incur a fine of between RUB 100,000 and 300,000 for the same offence (Article 19.7.5-2 of the CAO, see paragraph 24 above). Thus, solely because the organisation Woman’s World was included on the register of “foreign agents” and had failed to promptly submit its “foreign-agent” reports for the second and fourth quarters of 2016, the domestic courts fined it RUB 100,000 (see paragraph 682 below).155.  Since their classification as “foreign agents”, the applicant organisations have been subject to the additional obligation to undergo an annual audit. The Government insisted that that obligation was non‑discriminatory because it also applied to State-owned corporations. The Court does not consider that State corporations are a relevant comparator. They are large commercial operators managing public money, with substantial financial and human resources at their disposal; an audit of their spending is necessary to closely monitor the use of State funds and the fight against corruption, mismanagement and the wasteful allocation of resources. By contrast, non-commercial organisations had been submitting full financial reports, including their sources of funding, to the regulatory authorities even before the Foreign Agents Act. The Government did not explain how the new requirement increased the transparency of those organisations’ activities and protected “national security”. The Court also notes that auditing services are expensive and impose a significant financial and organisational burden on the applicant organisations (see paragraph 147 above). In the above-mentioned case of Woman’s World, an additional ground for imposing the RUB 100,000 fine related to the organisation’s failure to submit an audit report for 2016. The courts did not accept its explanation that it had not had the funds to pay for such a report.156.  An additional obligation on “foreign-agent” organisations was introduced in 2017: all organisations required by law to undergo a mandatory audit – a category which included “foreign-agent” organisations – were required to enter the results of the mandatory audits into the Unified Federal Register of Information on the Activities of Legal Entities via the online portal fedresurs.ru. The audit results needed to be uploaded within three business days of their receipt, making this requirement particularly burdensome in terms of urgency, but also in terms of cost, because in order to gain access to fedresurs.ru and publish their audit statements, the applicant organisations were forced to incur additional expenses associated with obtaining another special electronic signature which was different from that used in the banking sector. The Court notes that no comparable requirements applied to other non-commercial or commercial organisations, even though the latter group’s budget could significantly exceed the funding available to the applicant organisations.157.  The Court also notes that “foreign-agent” organisations may not use a simplified form of book-keeping which all other non-commercial organisations are eligible to use (see paragraph 29 above). The Government did not explain why it was considered necessary to deny such organisations the benefit of access to a form of accounting capable of reducing their paperwork.158.  Lastly, as regards the additional requirement to submit to inspections, the authorities carry out routine inspections of “foreign-agent” organisations three times more often than inspections of other non‑commercial organisations, on a triannual rather than annual basis. The Government did not offer any reasons for that increased supervision of the applicant organisations. Regardless of the declared aims to enhance transparency which have apparently been pursued, any risk of wrongdoing on the part of an organisation is effectively countered by the Ministry of Justice’s authority to conduct unscheduled inspections (see paragraph 18 above). While the important purpose served by inspections is undeniable, excessive use of the power to interfere with the operation of a civil society organisation should never be used as a tool to exercise control over NGOs.159.  In sum, the Court finds that the Government have failed to put forward “relevant and sufficient” reasons for imposing the additional requirements on the applicant organisations purely on account of their inclusion on the register of “foreign agents”. The Court is unable to find that the increased frequency of reporting and inspections, the obligation on “foreign-agent” organisations to undergo a mandatory audit and publish it on a dedicated website, or such organisations being denied the benefit of simplified book-keeping could substantially facilitate the provision of more transparent and complete information to the public, as the Government claimed it should. In any event, those additional measures imposed a significant and excessive financial and organisational burden on the applicant organisations and their staff, and undermined their capacity to engage in their core activities. The Court concludes that such additional requirements as provided for by the Foreign Agents Act and subsequent legislation were not “necessary in a democratic society” or proportionate to the declared aims.(iv)  Whether restricting access to sources of funding was necessary in a democratic society(α)     Submissions by the parties160.  The applicants pointed out that the Foreign Agents Act linked receiving foreign funding with a multitude of obligations, including more frequent reporting, keeping separate accounts for foreign funding, mandatory audits, the labelling of publications, more frequent inspections, and so on. The only way that they could escape the burden of the additional obligations was by completely refusing all foreign funding and returning any such funding previously awarded to their organisations. An increase in domestic funding over a seven-year period had been much less significant than the Government had claimed. Besides, the Government had only cited the total amounts allocated for all non-commercial organisations, without specifying the amount of funding allocated for activities in the areas in which the applicant organisations specialised. The Government had not specified the criteria for selecting applications for State funding, or indicated any safeguards capable of guaranteeing that applications for such funding were considered solely on their merits, rather than in terms of the compatibility of the applicant organisation’s views and opinions with the prevailing State policy. The applicants pointed out that virtually all of the applicant organisations which had applied for State funding had been unsuccessful, as had the other organisations included on the “foreign agents” register.161.  The Government submitted that the requirement to apply for registration as a “foreign-agent” did not prevent an organisation from receiving funds and property from foreign sources and international organisations. Nor were “foreign-agent” organisations in any way prevented from receiving support from the State. The State had launched a support programme to finance organisations implementing “projects of social importance” and “projects in the field of the protection of rights and freedoms”. Between 2011 and 2017 the total amount of State support had grown sevenfold, from RUB 1 billion to RUB 7 billion. In the 2018 budget, a total amount in excess of RUB 8 billion had been allocated for the development of civil society institutions implementing “projects of social importance”. Two applicant organisations, the Levada Centre and the Centre for Social and Labour Rights, had been awarded presidential grants in 2018 for research into palliative care and labour rights. Other applicant organisations, including Ryazan Memorial, Man and Law, the Chapayevsk Medical Association and Woman’s World, had taken part in the competition for presidential grants, but had been unsuccessful. In the Government’s view, this demonstrated that there were no obstacles for the applicant organisations which wished to apply for and receive State funding. Allocations and subsidies from the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation, and the federal and regional governments and ministries, supplemented the financial support of socially active NGOs.162.  The ILPP submitted that international law guaranteed access to resources for NGOs as an inherent part of their right to freedom of association (Article 6(f) of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief and Article 13 of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders). The Foreign Agents Act affected NGOs’ right to access funding to the extent that it discouraged reliance on foreign funding through the use of the pejorative term “foreign agent” and additional financial and administrative burdens on those NGOs which used foreign funding.163.  The Special Rapporteur submitted that freedom of association encompassed the right of NGOs to access financial resources. Without such resources, NGOs would not be able to enjoy freedom of association. The right to receive and use resources from foreign and international sources was recognised and protected in international law.164.  The ISHR, the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights and the Media Legal Defence Initiative indicated that many organisations had avoided seeking foreign financial support or had shut down because they could not comply with the excessive requirements. The negative stigma attached to the label “foreign agent” had discouraged Russian donors from cooperating with such organisations.(β)      The Court’s assessment165.  The Court reiterates that where the domestic law restricts an association’s ability to receive grants or other financial contributions which constitute one of the main sources of financing of NGOs, the association may fail to engage in activities which constitute the main purpose of its existence (see Ramazanova and Others v. Azerbaijan, no. 44363/02, § 59, 1 February 2007). While States may have legitimate reasons to monitor financial operations in accordance with international law, with a view to preventing money laundering and terrorism and extremism financing, the ability of an association to solicit, receive and use funding in order to be able to promote and defend its cause constitutes an integral part of the right to freedom of association (see Aliyev, cited above, § 212). The limits placed on a generalised restriction on the right to freedom of association and the availability of alternatives are also important factors in the assessment of its proportionality (see Animal Defenders International, cited above, § 117).166.  The Court concurs with the CJEU in that the objective of increasing the transparency of the financing of associations, although legitimate, cannot justify legislation which is based on a presumption, made on principle and applied indiscriminately, that any financial support by a non-national entity and any civil society organisation receiving such financial support are intrinsically liable to jeopardise the State’s political and economic interests and the ability of its institutions to operate free from interference. A regulatory framework needs to correspond with the scenario of a sufficiently serious threat to a fundamental interest of society, which those obligations are supposed to prevent (see paragraphs 46-47 above).167.  The Foreign Agents Act does not contain provisions prohibiting foreign funding altogether. However, it also does not establish a minimum amount or share of “foreign funding” in an organisation’s budget, with the result that an organisation regularly funded from abroad, an organisation which has been awarded an international prize for its work, and an organisation receiving a computer or software licence from an international company would all indiscriminately be considered to be funded by “foreign sources”. If an organisation receiving such funding is also deemed to have engaged in “political activities”, it is liable to be registered as a “foreign agent”. The Court has established above that in practice the domestic authorities gave an extremely wide and unforeseeable interpretation of the concepts of “foreign sources” and “political activities”. Even the usual activities of civil society organisations which were explicitly excluded from the scope of “political activity” were construed in such a way that almost any actions were taken to constitute “political activity” (see paragraphs 96 to 100 above). This situation rendered it difficult for the applicants to foresee which specific actions on their part could lead to their registration as “foreign agents”, registration which would entail a host of additional reporting and accounting requirements inhibiting their ability to function because of the substantial amount of staff time and resources such requirements would demand of an organisation.168.  In the absence of clear conditions for the applicability of the Foreign Agents Act, the only way for the applicant organisations to avoid the application of “foreign-agent” label and restrictions and continue their activities was to forego “foreign funding” altogether. The applicants were thus confronted with a choice between either refusing all “foreign funding” in the widest possible interpretation of the term, or incurring additional expenses relating to reporting, accounting and audit services and abiding by the other requirements, such as the labelling of publications and frequent inspections. By imposing that choice on the applicant organisations, the Foreign Agents Act made them opt for either exclusively domestic or foreign funding, thereby effectively restricting the available funding options.169.  The Court considers that an enforced choice between accepting foreign funding and soliciting domestic State funding represents a false alternative. In order to ensure that NGOs are able to perform their role as the “watchdogs of society”, they should be free to solicit and receive funding from a variety of sources. The diversity of these sources may enhance the independence of the recipients of such funding in a democratic society.170.  Furthermore, the Court is not convinced by the Government’s assertion that the domestic grants and subsidies for non-commercial organisations implementing “projects of social importance” could have adequately compensated for the previously available foreign and international funding.171.  Firstly, the Government’s reference to the existing support for “socially-oriented” organisations is not relevant to this case because, by virtue of a direct ban in the legislation, “foreign-agent” organisations – such as the applicant organisations – may not be granted the status of “providers of useful social services” and apply for priority funding which is exclusively associated with that status (see paragraph 33 above). Unlike other non‑commercial organisations, organisations which have been recognised as “foreign agents” also cannot be considered “socially-oriented” and thus gain access to State financial support programmes, even though charity work is explicitly excluded from the scope of the Foreign Agents Act.172.  Secondly, owing to the applicants’ ineligibility to obtain financing as “socially-oriented” organisations, and the poorly developed private donor system in Russia, domestic financing may only come from the federal budget in the form of presidential grants. While the Government emphasised that there had been a significant increase in the amounts allocated for grants, they did not provide any indication as to the criteria for grant allocation and, most importantly, institutional guarantees confirming that grant operators would be independent and capable of ensuring that money was allocated to meritorious projects. Experts who studied the practice of grant allocation at the material time concluded that non-commercial organisations closely aligned with the State authorities were by far the largest beneficiaries of grants (see paragraph 64 above).173.  The Government were unable to show that the applicant organisations which had been forced to refuse foreign funding under the threat of being included on the register of “foreign agents” could have secured access to domestic funding on a transparent and non-discriminatory basis. Nor did the Government put forward “relevant and sufficient” reasons for causing the applicant organisations to choose between continuing their work while accepting foreign funding and the burdensome requirements of “foreign-agent” status, and significantly reducing their activities on account of insufficient domestic funding or a complete lack thereof. Without proper financing, the applicant organisations were unable to carry out activities constituting the main objective of their existence, and some of them had to be wound up. Neither the executive authorities nor the domestic courts considered the consequences of the “foreign-funding” provisions for the work of those organisations, or the accessibility of alternative funding in Russia. It follows that the restrictions on access to funding have not been shown to be necessary in a democratic society.(v)    Nature and severity of the penalties(α)     Submissions by the parties174.  The applicant organisations contended that they had been fined for failing to submit the required application for registration as a “foreign agent” to the Ministry of Justice, since they had been unable to foresee that their activities would be deemed “political” within the meaning of the Foreign Agents Act. However, their actions had not and could not have entailed any negative consequences, such as a threat to national security or public safety. The Government had not submitted any evidence showing that a real risk of harm to any of the values guaranteed by the Convention had existed as a result of the applicants’ actions. Even assuming that there had been a danger in principle in a non-commercial organisation not registering as a “foreign agent”, this had been completely neutralised by the power of the Ministry of Justice to include organisations on the register of foreign agents at its own discretion. The sanctions had been not just excessive, but also unpredictable, and the amounts of fines imposed on the applicant organisations and their directors had varied greatly. The legislation did not provide any indication as to what would constitute a less serious or more serious offence entailing less and more serious sanctions.175.  The Government claimed that the sanctions for the violations of the Foreign Agents Act had been proportionate to the gravity of the offences. The provisions of the Act were accessible and foreseeable, and also clearly formulated without ambiguities or contradictions. Since the 2014 judgment of the Constitutional Court, it had been possible to reduce the amount of an administrative fine for “foreign-agent” offences under Article 19.34 of the CAO below the lower limit provided for by that Article, and the domestic courts had applied lower fines in several cases. If the courts had not considered the potential impact of the relevant fines on the sustainability of the applicants’ work, this was due to the applicant organisations’ failure to plead financial difficulty and provide documentation concerning their financial situation. All sanctions imposed to date had been administrative in nature; the criminal liability provisions under Article 330.1 of the Criminal Code had not yet been applied. The Government also claimed that the legislation of other States provided for the imposition of sanctions comparable to those provided for by the Foreign Agents Act for similar offences.176.  The Commissioner submitted that it was unclear what criteria were used by the Ministry of Justice when assessing the necessity of the application of administrative sanctions as opposed to other, less intrusive, measures. Bearing in mind that non-commercial organisations, by their very nature, were not engaged in profit-making activities, fines represented a major burden to many small Russian non-commercial organisations, and a significant portion of their annual budget. The imposition of administrative fines on individual managers was a reason for serious concern. In the case of the Partnership for Development, its former director Ms Pitsunova had been deprived of half of her pension and disability payments in 2015 owing to her inability to pay an initial administrative fine of RUB 100,000 on time in 2014.177.  The Special Rapporteur submitted that provisions on sanctions should provide for adequate warning and an opportunity to remedy violations, and that States should not criminalise or delegitimise activities in defence of human rights on account of the origin of funding.178.  The ICJ, Amnesty International, and the Media Legal Defence Initiative stated that harsh punitive measures, including criminal sanctions, provided for by the Foreign Agents Act were bound to have a chilling effect on NGOs. They hardly constituted the least intrusive measures available to achieve the protection of the interests at stake, and were therefore likely to be disproportionate.(β)      The Court’s assessment179.  The Court reiterates that the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are important factors to be considered when assessing the proportionality of an interference (see Bédat v. Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, § 79, 29 March 2016, and Tebieti Mühafize Cemiyyeti and Israfilov, cited above, § 82). The Court must be satisfied that the penalty does not amount to a form of censorship intended to discourage the applicants from expressing criticism or undermine civil society’s important contribution to the administration of public affairs. By the same token, the penalty should not be such as to be liable to hamper NGOs in performing their task as independent monitors and “public watchdogs” (see Társaság a Szabadságjogokért v. Hungary, no. 37374/05, § 27, 14 April 2009, and Magyar Helsinki Bizottság, cited above, § 159).180.  The Foreign Agents Act introduced fines of between RUB 100,000 and RUB 500,000 for continuing the activities of an organisation without registering as a “foreign agent”, failing to comply with additional accounting or reporting requirements, and failing to label publications as originating from a “foreign-agent” organisation (see paragraph 24 above). It also introduced criminal liability for individuals who deliberately omitted to provide documents for registration of an organisation as a “foreign agent” (see paragraph 23 above). Even in those cases where, further to the Constitutional Court’s judgment, the applicant organisations were sentenced to fines below the lower limit provided for by the CAO, the minimum amount was set at RUB 150,000 for a violation of Article 19.34 of the CAO, since, in accordance with the law, the amount of the fine could not be less than half of the amount constituting the lower limit of the sanction.181.  In order to put the financial impact of sanctions into perspective, the Court has previously considered it appropriate to use, as a relevant comparator, the monthly minimum salary, which is set and regularly reviewed by the Federal Assembly (see Tolmachev v. Russia, no. 42182/11, § 54, 2 June 2020). Between 2013 and 2019 the monthly minimum salary went up from RUB 5,205 to RUB 11,280 (from EUR 129 to EUR 142 at the 1 January exchange rate). It follows that even the minimum amount of the relevant fine was set at a level exceeding the monthly minimum salary by a factor of between thirty (in 2013) and thirteen (in 2019) or, in other words, it was approximately equivalent to one to three years’ subsistence income. Using the sanctions for other types of administrative offences as another relevant comparator, the Court notes that the sanctions applicable to “foreign-agent” organisations were many times higher than the sanctions for analogous offences committed by non-commercial organisations which did not have the status of a “foreign agent” (see paragraph 154 above).182.  The Court reiterates that sanctions of that magnitude will trigger heightened scrutiny of their proportionality (see Pakdemirli v. Turkey, no. 35839/97, § 59, 22 February 2005). In order to be proportionate, the interference should correspond to the severity of the infringement, and the sanction to the gravity of the offence it is designed to punish (see Independent News and Media and Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited v. Ireland, no. 55120/00, § 110‑13, ECHR 2005‑V (extracts), and Gyrlyan v. Russia, no. 35943/15, § 28, 9 October 2018). The Government did not put forward any relevant and sufficient reasons for setting the fines for what were essentially regulatory offences at such a high level. They did not advance arguments as to why such punishment was not excessive or liable to turn the fines into an instrument for suppressing dissent. Taking into account that the amount of the fine cannot be reduced below half of the minimum amount of the fine under the CAO, and that some of the applicant organisations were fined multiple times, the fines were unaffordable for many of them. Some had to significantly scale down their activities or be wound up, as they were unable to pay the fines which had already been imposed or face further fines. Thus, as it was unable to pay fines totalling RUB 600,000 for a failure to label banners and several Internet publications, the Committee against Torture was driven into voluntary dissolution.183.  The domestic courts failed to provide “relevant and sufficient reasons” for their choice of sanctions. They did not consider the proportionality of a fine in particular in relation to its impact on the organisation’s ability to continue its work. For example, Yekaterinburg Memorial was fined three times for violations of the Foreign Agents Act – once for failing to register as a “foreign agent”, and twice for failing to label publications published on the organisation’s website. The amount of each fine was RUB 300,000. The domestic courts gave no consideration to the fact that Yekaterinburg Memorial did not have any financial resources or property of its own. In another example, the publishing house Gagarin Park was fined RUB 300,000 for receiving cash funds in the amount of RUB 100,000 for the implementation of a project.184.  The domestic case-law presented to the Court seems to indicate that the sanctions were also unpredictable. The Foreign Agents Act did not provide for any guidance as to what would amount to a more serious offence or a less serious one, or list relevant factors and criteria for judicial assessment. Nor did it determine with any degree of precision the circumstances in which a particular punishment bracket applied. For example, Man and Law was fined RUB 150,000 for a blog publication by a staff member published on the website of a popular regional periodical, while the Sakharov Centre was fined RUB 400,000 for publishing information on its own website, which had considerably fewer visitors. In some cases, like the case of Public Verdict, the applicant organisation was ordered to pay a single fine for several publications, while others, like MASHR, were fined separately for each unlabelled publication. The latter approach also resulted in excessive and burdensome fines, as illustrated by the case of the Golos Association, which paid three fines totalling RUB 1,200,000. In the absence of any other factors which may explain the great variations in the fines imposed, the Court finds that the provisions governing the amounts of the fines left room for arbitrariness (compare Camilleri v. Malta, no. 42931/10, §§ 42-43, 22 January 2013).185.  Taking into account the essentially regulatory nature of the offences, the substantial amounts of the administrative fines imposed and their frequent accumulation, and the fact that the applicants were not‑for‑profit civil society organisations which suffered a reduction in their budgets due to restrictions on foreign funding, the Court holds that the fines provided for by the Foreign Agents Act cannot be regarded as being proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. This finding would be applicable a fortiori to criminal sanctions, since a failure to comply with formal requirements relating to the re-registration of an NGO can hardly warrant a criminal conviction and is disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.(vi)  Conclusion on the necessity requirement186.  The Court has found above that the Government have not shown relevant and sufficient reasons for creating a special status of “foreign agents”, imposing additional reporting and accounting requirements on organisations registered as “foreign agents”, restricting their access to funding options, and punishing any breaches of the Foreign Agents Act in an unforeseeable and disproportionately severe manner. The cumulative effect of these restrictions – whether by design or effect – is a legal regime that places a significant “chilling effect” on the choice to seek or accept any amount of foreign funding, however insignificant, in a context where opportunities for domestic funding are rather limited, especially in respect of politically or socially sensitive topics or domestically unpopular causes. The measures accordingly cannot be considered “necessary in a democratic society”.(e)   Overall conclusion187.  Having regard to the foregoing, the Court concludes that the interference was neither prescribed by law nor necessary in a democratic society. Therefore, there has been a violation of Article 11 of the Convention interpreted in the light of Article 10.ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 14 AND 18 TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLES 10 AND 11 OF THE CONVENTION188.  Some applicants also complained that they had been subjected to discrimination on account of their political position, and that their freedom of expression and association had been restricted for purposes other than those prescribed by the Convention. They relied on Articles 14 and 18 taken in conjunction with Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.189.  The Court considers that these complaints must be declared admissible. However, since it has already considered the claim that the applicant organisations were put into a separate category and singled out for a differential treatment on the basis of the source of their funding, it does not need to examine whether, in this case, there has been a violation of Article 14 or 18.COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLE 34 OF THE CONVENTION190.  As regards compliance with Article 34 of the Convention, the Court will examine whether the enforcement of the dissolution order against the International Memorial (see paragraph 14 above) disclosed a failure to comply with the interim measure indicated by the Court under Rule 39 and violated its right of individual application. Article 34 of the Convention reads as follows:“The Court may receive applications from any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto. The High Contracting Parties undertake not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of this right.”191.  The Government did not reply to the Court’s request for comments.192.  The Court reiterates that, by virtue of Article 34 of the Convention, Contracting States undertake to refrain from any act or omission that may hinder the effective exercise of the right of individual application, which has been consistently reaffirmed as a cornerstone of the Convention system. According to the Court’s established case-law, a respondent State’s failure to comply with an interim measure entails a violation of that right (see Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, §§ 102 and 125, ECHR 2005‑I, and Savriddin Dzhurayev v. Russia, no. 71386/10, §§ 211-13, ECHR 2013 (extracts)).193.  After the dissolution order against the International Memorial was issued at first instance, on 29 December 2021 the Court, having regard to the close connection of the grounds of dissolution and the subject matter of the present case, indicated an interim measure under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. It held that, in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings before it, the enforcement of the order should be suspended for a period that would be necessary for the Court to consider the present case. After the order became final and enforceable on 28 February 2022 (see paragraph 12 above), the International Memorial asked the Supreme Court for a stay of execution by reference to the Court’s indication of an interim measure. Its application was declined. On 5 April 2022 the International Memorial was liquidated, while the Court’s interim measure was still in force.194.  In view of the vital role played by interim measures in the Convention system, they must be strictly complied with by the State concerned (see Savriddin Dzhurayev, cited above, § 217). By allowing the dissolution of the International Memorial to proceed, the State frustrated the purpose of the interim measure which sought to maintain the status quo pending the Court’s examination of the application. Since there is no procedure in Russian law for reinstating the legal-entity status of an organisation following its removal from the State Register of Legal Entities, the Court was prevented from securing the International Memorial’s enjoyment of the rights to freedom of expression and association under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.195.  Consequently, the Court concludes that the Russian authorities disregarded the interim measure indicated by the Court under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, in violation of their obligation under Article 34 of the Convention.APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION196.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”197.  The applicants claimed various amounts in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, and also costs and expenses.

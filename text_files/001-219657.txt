  THIRD SECTIONCASE OF ARKHIPOV AND OTHERS v. RUSSIA(Applications nos. 26454/13 and 9 others –see appended list)      JUDGMENT STRASBOURG13 October 2022 This judgment is final but it may be subject to editorial revision.In the case of Arkhipov and Others v. Russia,The European Court of Human Rights (Third Section), sitting as a Committee composed of: Darian Pavli, President, Andreas Zünd, Frédéric Krenc, judges,and Viktoriya Maradudina, Acting Deputy Section Registrar,Having deliberated in private on 15 September 2022,Delivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date:PROCEDURE1.  The case originated in applications against Russia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) on the various dates indicated in the appended table.2.  The Russian Government (“the Government”) were given notice of the applications.THE FACTS3.  The list of the applicants and the relevant details of the applications are set out in the appended table.4.  The applicants complained of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. Some applicants also raised other complaints under various provisions of the Convention.THE LAWJOINDER OF THE APPLICATIONS5.  Having regard to the similar subject matter of the applications, the Court finds it appropriate to examine them jointly in a single judgment.THE GOVERNMENT’S REQUEST TO STRIKE OUT THE APPLICATIONS UNDER ARTICLE 37 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION6.  The Government submitted unilateral declarations in all applications, save for application no. 30885/16, whereby they acknowledged a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in respect of the applicants.7.  The applicants rejected the Government’s proposals.8.  Considering the circumstances of the case at hand, the Court rejects the Government’s requests to strike the applications out and will accordingly pursue their examination (see Tahsin Acar v. Turkey (preliminary issue) [GC], no. 26307/95, § 75, ECHR 2003‑VI).ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 of the Convention9.  The applicants complained of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment and the lack of an effective investigation thereof. They relied, expressly or in substance, on Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:Article 3““No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”10.  The Court has found in Bouyid v. Belgium ([GC], no. 23380/09, §§ 81-90 and 114-23, ECHR 2015), that presumptions of fact was in favour of applicants claiming to be victims of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, if they demonstrate that the alleged ill-treatment was inflicted when they were under the control of the police or a similar authority. Moreover, in the context of detainees, the Court has emphasised that persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and that the authorities are under a duty to protect their physical well-being and that any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by the applicants’ own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 of the Convention (see Sheydayev v. Russia, no. 65859/01, § 59, 7 December 2006). The burden of proof rests on the Government to demonstrate that the use of force, which resulted in the applicants’ injuries, was not excessive (see, for example, Dzwonkowski v. Poland, no. 46702/99, § 51, 12 April 2007, and compare with Kursish and Others v. Russia [Committee], no. 62003/08 and 5 others, § 84, 5 July 2022).11.  Furthermore, in the cases of Lyapin v. Russia, no. 46956/09, §§ 128-40, 24 July 2014 and Samesov v. Russia, no. 57269/14, §§ 54-63, 20 November 2018, as well as in Kuchta and Mętel v. Poland, no. 76813/16, § 88, 2 September 2021 the Court has already found, in particular, that the authorities’ refusal to institute a fully-fledged criminal investigation into the credible allegations of ill-treatment, as well as the lack of assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the use of lawful force by the police were indicative of the State’s failure to comply with its procedural obligation under Article 3 of the Convention.12.  Taking into account the case-law referred to above and having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the complaints raised under the substantive limb of Article 3 of the Convention by the applicant in application no. 30885/16 and the complaint by the applicant regarding one episode of his alleged ill-treatment in application no. 4673/15 (see the appended table for the remaining episode) do not meet the admissibility criteria set out in Article 35 of the Convention.13.  The Court further finds the remaining complaints admissible and observes that there has been a breach of the substantive and procedural limbs of Article 3 of the Convention in respect of all the applicants, save for the applicant in application no. 30885/16, in respect of whom it finds a violation of only the procedural limb of that provision.OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS UNDER WELL-ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW14.  In applications nos. 16097/18 and 58738/15 the applicants submitted other complaints which also raised issues under the Convention, given the relevant well-established case-law of the Court (see appended table). These complaints are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention, nor are they inadmissible on any other ground. Accordingly, they must be declared admissible. Having examined all the material before it, the Court concludes that they also disclose violations of the Convention in the light of its findings in Ksenz and Others v. Russia, nos. 45044/06 and 5 others, §§ 111-12, 12 December 2017, Tangiyev v. Russia, no. 27610/05, § 76, 11 December 2012 and Belugin v. Russia, no. 2991/06, §§ 69-71, 26 November 2019.REMAINING COMPLAINTS15.  The applicant in application no. 30885/16 also raised other complaints under various Convention provisions.16.  The Court has examined these complaints and considers that, in the light of all the material in its possession and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence, they either do not meet the admissibility criteria set out in Articles 34 and 35 of the Convention or do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Convention or the Protocols thereto.17.  It follows that these parts of the application must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 § 4 of the Convention.18. Furthermore, the applicants in applications nos. 26454/13, 62846/13, 73154/13 and no. 4673/15 also submitted complaints under Article 13 of the Convention. These complaints are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention, nor are they inadmissible on any other ground. Accordingly, they must be declared admissible. Having examined all the material before it, the Court concludes that there is no need to examine them separately in view of its findings under Article 3 of the Convention (see Aleksandr Andreyev v. Russia, no. 2281/06, § 71, 23 February 2016 and Leonid Petrov v. Russia, no. 52783/08, § 86, 11 October 2016).APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION19.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”20.  Regard being had to the documents in its possession and to its case‑law (see Ksenz and Others, cited above, § 120; and, for similar situations, Zagaynov and Others v. Russia [Committee], nos. 5666/07 and 4 others, 15 June 2021, and Dauberkov and Others v. Russia [Committee], no. 60844/11 and 2 others, § 64, 22 March 2022), the Court considers it reasonable to award the sums indicated in the appended table and dismisses the remainder of the applicants’ claims for just satisfaction.21.  The Court further considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT, UNANIMOUSLY,Decides to join the applications;Rejects the Government’s request to strike the applications, save for application no. 30885/16, out of its list of cases under Article 37 § 1 of the Convention on the basis of the unilateral declarations which they submitted;Declares the complaints concerning the torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, as described in detail in the appended table, and the lack of an effective domestic remedy in that regard, as well as the other complaints under well-established case-law of the Court, set out in the appended table, admissible, and the remainder of applications nos. 4673/15 and 30885/16 inadmissible;Holds that these complaints disclose a breach of Article 3 of the Convention concerning the torture or inhuman or degrading treatment;Holds that there is no need to examine separately the complaint under Article 13 of the Convention;Holds that there has been a violation of the Convention as regards the other complaints raised under well-established case-law of the Court (see appended table);

   FIFTH SECTIONCASE OF ZABOLOTNYY AND OTHERS v. UKRAINE(Applications nos. 19574/09 and 2 others)      JUDGMENT        STRASBOURG3 September 2020 This judgment is final but it may be subject to editorial revision.In the case of Zabolotnyy and others v. Ukraine,The European Court of Human Rights (Fifth Section), sitting as a Committee composed of:Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer, President,Lado Chanturia,Anja Seibert-Fohr, judges,and Anne-Marie Dougin, Acting Deputy Section Registrar,Having regard to:the applications (nos. 19574/09, 48353/09 and 8297/10) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Ukrainian nationals, Mr Yuriy Mykolayovych Zabolotnyy, Mr Andrey Borisovich Drobotenko and Mr Valentin Vladimirovich Koliychuk (“the applicants”), on the various dates indicated in the appended tables;the decision to give notice of the applications to the Ukrainian Government (“the Government”);the parties’ observations;Having deliberated in private on 30 June 2020,Delivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date:INTRODUCTION1.  The present case concerns alleged ill-treatment of the applicants by police and the allegedly ineffective investigation of their respective complaints. In addition, it concerns an allegation by one of the applicants that the conditions of his detention were inhuman and degrading and that he had no effective remedies for this complaint.THE FACTS2.  The applicants’ details and the relevant facts are set out in the appended tables.3.  The Government were represented by their Agent, Mr I. Lishchyna.THE LAWJOINDER OF THE APPLICATIONS4.  Having regard to the similar subject matter of the applications, the Court finds it appropriate to examine them jointly in a single judgment.ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE ILL-TREATMENT5.  The applicants complained that they had been ill-treated by the police and that their respective complaints had not been properly investigated. They referred to Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention.6.  The Court, which is master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of a case, finds that the complaints at issue fall to be examined under Article 3 of the Convention only (see, among other authorities, Barysheva v. Ukraine, no. 9505/12, § 45, 14 March 2017). That provision reads as follows:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”AdmissibilityApplication no. 19574/09 by Mr Y. Zabolotnyy7.  The Government submitted that Mr Zabolotnyy’s complaints should be dismissed as introduced outside of the six-month time-limit. They argued that the relevant period was to be calculated from 27 February 2008, when the District Court dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant against the decision not to institute criminal proceedings into his ill-treatment allegations (see appended table 1.B.2 for details). Alternatively, they suggested that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies, as he had not brought the substance of his complaints before the higher courts as a result of his own procedural negligence.8.  The applicant contested that view.9.  Viewing the parties’ submissions in the light of the principles developed in its case law (see, in particular, Kaverzin v. Ukraine, no. 23893/03, §§ 90-99 and 172-80, 15 May 2012, Zamferesko v. Ukraine, no. 30075/06, §§ 39-41, 15 November 2012; and Buglov v. Ukraine, no. 28825/02, § 63, 10 July 2014) the Court finds that the applicant in the present case provided the domestic authorities with appropriate opportunities to deal with his allegations. It also considers that he cannot be reproached for waiting for the Supreme Court to take a decision concerning his appeal.10.  The Court therefore dismisses the Government’s objections concerning non-compliance with the six-month rule and non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.Other applications11.  The Government submitted no objections concerning the admissibility of the aforementioned complaints raised in the other applications within the time-limits established for that purpose.Court’s overall conclusion concerning all applications12.  The Court notes that the applicants’ aforementioned complaints under Article 3 of the Convention are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible.Merits13.  The applicants alleged that there had been violations of Article 3 of the Convention under both its substantive and procedural limbs in each of their respective cases.14.  The Government contested this allegation in respect of the complaints raised in applications nos. 19574/09 and 8297/10. In respect of application no. 48353/09, no observations were received within the time-limit established by the Court.15.  The Court reiterates that in respect of a person who is deprived of his liberty or, more generally, is confronted with law-enforcement officers, any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his or her own conduct diminishes human dignity and is an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see, among other authorities, El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, § 207, ECHR 2012, and Bouyid v. Belgium ([GC], no. 23380/09, § 101, 28 September 2015).16.  Reviewing the facts of the present cases in the light of the general principles established in its case-law (see, among other authorities, Bouyid, cited above, §§ 81-90 and 114-23), the Court considers that the applicants raised arguable ill-treatment claims at the domestic level. Those claims triggered an obligation on the part of the national authorities to carry out an effective official investigation with a view to establishing the origins of the applicants’ injuries and identifying and punishing those responsible, should the applicants’ allegations concerning ill-treatment have proved to be true.17.  From the documents before the Court it appears that the domestic investigations did not reflect a serious effort to determine the relevant facts (see the appended tables for individual details).18.  In the case of Kaverzin, (cited above, §§ 173-80), the Court found that the reluctance of the authorities to ensure a prompt and thorough investigation of ill-treatment complaints lodged against police authorities constituted a systemic problem within the meaning of Article 46 of the Convention. In view of the circumstances of the present applications and its previous case-law, the Court considers that they constitute another example of such a failure to ensure prompt and thorough investigation.19.  The Court further finds that the applicants’ accounts as to the circumstances of their alleged ill-treatment are detailed and coherent, and that the results of the investigations, given their numerous shortcomings, did not disprove them. In these circumstances, and given the onus on the State to provide a plausible explanation for injuries sustained by persons under the control of the police (see, Bouyid, cited above, § 83 and also, by way of example, Adnaralov v. Ukraine, no. 10493/12, § 45, 27 November 2014; Kulik v. Ukraine, no. 10397/10, § 59, 19 March 2015; and Yaroshovets and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 74820/10 and 4 others, § 85, 3 December 2015), the Court concludes that the State’s responsibility for the applicants’ ill‑treatment is engaged.20.  The above findings are sufficient for the Court to establish that the applicants were subjected to ill-treatment which must be classified as inhuman and degrading.21.  There has, accordingly, been a breach of Article 3 of the Convention under both its procedural and substantive limbs.OTHER COMPLAINTSApplication no. 19574/09 by Mr Y. Zabolotnyy22.  Mr Y. Zabolotnyy additionally complained that his conviction for insubordination to the police, followed by three days’ administrative detention, had not been amenable to appeal. Referring to the Court’s findings in the judgment in the case of Gurepka v. Ukraine (no. 61406/00, §§ 59-62, 6 September 2005), he submitted that there had been a breach of Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention in his case.23.  The Government argued that this complaint had been submitted outside of the six-month time-limit.24.  The applicant disagreed with the Government, but did not put forward any specific arguments.25.  The Court notes that the final decision in the applicant’s case was taken by the Leninskyy District Court in Vinnytsia on 8 January 2008, that is, more than six months before the present application was lodged (10 March 2009). It therefore upholds the Government’s objection.26.  It follows that this part of the aforementioned application was lodged outside of the six-month time-limit and must therefore be rejected as inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention.Application no. 48353/09 by Mr A. Drobotenko27.  Mr A. Drobotenko complained that the conditions of his detention in Kherson SIZO had been inhuman and degrading (see details in appended table 2.C) and that there had been no effective remedies for his relevant complaint.28.  The Government did not submit observations on the subject within the established time-limit.29.  The Court refers to the principles established in its case-law regarding inadequate conditions of detention (see, for instance, Muršić v. Croatia [GC], no. 7334/13, §§ 96‑101, ECHR 2016). It reiterates in particular that a serious lack of space in a prison cell weighs heavily as a factor to be taken into account for the purpose of establishing whether the detention conditions described are “degrading” from the point of view of Article 3 and may disclose a violation, taken alone or together with other shortcomings (see Muršić, cited above, §§ 122‑41, and Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, §§ 149‑59, 10 January 2012).30.  In the leading case of Melnik v. Ukraine (no. 72286/01, §§ 110-12, 28 March 2006; for more recent case-law see Beketov v. Ukraine [Committee], no. 44436/09, §§ 125-30, 19 February 2019), the Court found a violation in respect of issues similar to those in the present case.31.  Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court has not found any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion on the admissibility and merits of the present complaints. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the applicant’s conditions of detention were inadequate.32.  The Court further notes that the applicant did not have at his disposal an effective remedy in respect of his complaint concerning the conditions of his detention.33.  The applicant’s complaints under Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention are therefore admissible and disclose breaches of those provisions.APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION34.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”35.  Regard being had to the documents in its possession and to its case-law, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicants the sums indicated in the appended tables. It dismisses the remainder of the applicants’ claims for just satisfaction.36.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT, UNANIMOUSLY, Decides to join the applications;Declares the complaint under Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 raised in application no. 19574/09 inadmissible and the remainder of the applications admissible;Holds that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention under both its substantive and procedural limbs in respect of the complaints concerning ill-treatment by the police raised by all of the applicants;Holds that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in respect of the complaint concerning the conditions of detention raised in application no. 48353/09;Holds that there has been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 3 of the Convention in respect of the complaint concerning the conditions of detention raised in application no. 48353/09;Holds(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicants, within three months, the amounts indicated in the appended tables, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement, simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period, plus three percentage points;Dismisses the remainder of the applicants’ claims for just satisfaction.Done in English, and notified in writing on 3 September 2020, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.Anne-Marie DouginGabriele Kucsko-StadlmayerActing Deputy RegistrarPresident APPENDIX  1.  Application no. 19574/09by Mr Yuriy Mykolayovych ZabolotnyyUkrainian national born in 1973 and residing in VinnytsiaLodged on 10 March 2009A.  Complaint under Article 3: substantive limbAlleged ill-treatmentKey issues1.  Date/places:12/12/07 - (i)  during arrest (at warehouse), (ii)  in police car, and (iii) in office no. 508 of Vinnytsia regional organised crime police unit (“UBOZ”)2.  Applicant’s description of alleged ill-treatment:(i)  Several police officers in plain clothes, accompanied by X (private party) arrived at warehouse where applicant was on business, and demanded that he step into their car “for a conversation” concerning allegation that he had assaulted X earlier that day.

Officers X and Y dragged him out, punched him in face and head; placed him face down on boot of his car, with hands handcuffed behind back. Officer Y held applicant’s handcuffed hands upwards, while officer Z repeatedly hit him with truncheon in back and buttocks. Officers also poured alcohol and tear gas onto applicant’s face.

He had then attempted to hit approaching officers with hammer and had punched officer Y in stomach, causing him to fall.
